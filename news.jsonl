Identifying refracture risk is crucial for implementing effective preventive strategies. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of refracture following an initial vertebral fragility fracture.\nMETHODS: The study included both men and women, focusing on individuals aged 60 and above. The fractures were diagnosed using X-rays. Participants from three centers were used for model development, while the fourth center was used for validation. The discrimination and calibration of each model was assessed using the validation set. A predictive model for preoperative refracture risk was developed using logistic regression analysis and visualized via a nomogram.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,632 participants with a median age of 72 years were enrolled, of whom 428 had experienced a refracture. Eleven factors were identified as significant predictors of refracture: age, rehabilitation status, treatment regimen, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), duration of medication use, history of comorbidities, fall risk, and levels of bone gla protein (BGP), total alkaline phosphatase (TALP), and homocysteine (Hcy).

This study combines cross-sectional and meta-analytic methods to comprehensively explore the relationship between DN and osteoporosis in T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study included 523 T2DM patients, classified into DN and non-DN groups. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and multivariate analysis identified osteoporosis-related factors. The meta-analysis included studies published from 1999 to 2021, comparing BMD between patients with and without DN. The results showed that while significant differences in clinical characteristics and biochemical indices (such as age, HbA1c, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels) were observed between the groups, no significant association between DN and osteoporosis was found after adjusting for covariates like body mass index and blood pressure. Additionally, the meta-analysis confirmed no significant impact of DN on BMD across skeletal sites, including the lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck.

However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.\nOBJECTIVES: This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.\nMETHODS: We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.\nRESULTS: A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption.

Web-based interventions (WBIs) can be used to achieve this goal.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the treatment needs of young people with GD in Germany and derive implications for the development of a self-guided WBI for GD.\nMETHODS: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted a focus group with 3 young male adults and semistructured individual interviews with 3 male adolescents. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The reporting of this study followed the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines.\nRESULTS: Participants' expectations of web-based help in general and of a self-guided WBI for GD revealed a wide variety of sometimes conflicting user needs. For example, by analyzing participants' experiences with successful strategies, we found that external stabilizers (eg, parental control and support group meetings) were helpful in managing GD. However, with regard to a WBI, participants described it as a barrier if the WBI created \"too much pressure.\" On the other hand, \"not enough pressure\" (ie, not enough external control) was also mentioned as a barrier. The belief that gaming is rewarding and that only equally rewarding activities are successful alternatives to gaming is in tension with the fact that changing problematic gaming behavior can be stressful and not feel rewarding at all. The data also showed that, on the one hand, a WBI should be designed to be attractive (eg, by incorporating gaming elements) but that it should not be too attractive as this, in turn, could trigger GD.\nCONCLUSIONS: A self-guided WBI for GD should consider and address conflicting user needs. Ambivalence of needs in the face of coping with GD should not be seen as a problem but as a normal part of a change process and, therefore, actively integrated into the WBI concept and storyline.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00032334; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00032334.", "authors": ["Geisler Birte Linny", "Petersen Kay Uwe", "Hanke Sara", "Schurer Simon", "Schreiber Anne", "Lämmle Christine", "Batra Anil", "Renner Tobias", "Brandhorst Isabel"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "矛盾的使用者需求：設計網路成癮網路介入措施的挑戰與機遇——青少年與年輕成人之質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "本研究探討德國網路遊戲成癮青少年和年輕人對網路介入治療的需求。研究發現，使用者對於網路介入抱持著複雜且矛盾的期望。例如，他們需要外部支持（如家長控制和支持團體），但同時又排斥過度的壓力。他們認為遊戲本身具有吸引力，但網路介入又不能過於吸引人，以免反過來觸發成癮行為。研究結論指出，設計網路遊戲成癮的網路介入措施時，應考慮並處理這些矛盾的需求。將這些矛盾視為改變過程中的正常現象，並將其納入網路介入的設計和故事主線中，才能更有效地幫助使用者。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果你的孩子沉迷遊戲，這個研究可以幫助你設計一個既能引導孩子，又不會讓他們反感的網路戒癮計畫，就像一個溫柔的導師，而不是嚴厲的監管者。", "很多年輕人想戒掉遊戲癮，但又覺得很難。這個研究就像一份客製化的地圖，告訴設計師如何打造一個既有趣又能幫助他們擺脫遊戲的網路工具，讓戒癮不再是痛苦的掙扎，而是一場有趣的冒險。", "對於開發網路戒癮App的公司來說，這項研究提供寶貴的洞察，讓他們知道如何設計出真正符合使用者需求的產品，避免一味地強制控制，而是創造一個更人性化、更有效的解決方案。"], "audio": "audios/40418804.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:40:59.790015"}

As medical knowledge expands, clinicians are increasingly using evidence-based point-of-care information (POCI) resources to facilitate clinical decision-making in medical practices. While these tools can improve clinical outcomes, few studies have assessed clinicians' opinions on integrating them with EHRs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess clinicians' attitudes and the perceived value of POCI resources for finding medication- and disease-related information in clinical practice and their integration with EHRs.\nMETHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 clinicians from various roles and specialties between December 2021 and January 2022 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. A content analysis approach was used to examine participants' responses and feedback on their current use of POCI resources, barriers and facilitators, mobile app use, and recommendations for improved integration.\nRESULTS: Of the 10 participants, 6 (60%) were female, 9 (90%) were aged <40 years, and 8 (80%) had ≤10 years of experience in clinical practice. While UpToDate was the most preferred disease-related information resource (n=9, 90%), preferences for medication-related resources varied, with 2 (20%) participants favoring Micromedex, 2 (20%) favoring Lexicomp, 2 (20%) favoring Brigham and Women's Hospital-specific drug administration guidelines, 2 (20%) favoring UpToDate, and 1 (10%) favoring Medscape. Most participants used their preferred tools weekly. Most clinicians preferred comprehensive POCI tools with clear, navigable layouts that eased and quickened the search for information. Features such as heavy text density, the lack of citations, and frequent log-ins to access the tool were viewed as barriers that limited content legibility, credibility, and accessibility. Access-related, tool-specific, and integration-related barriers were reported to negatively impact clinical workflow. Most (n=8, 80%) of the participants reported currently using mobile apps, reasoning that they facilitated quick and convenient searches for information; however, frequent updates, time-consuming log-ins, and high text density on smaller screens posed challenges. Most participants favored further integration of POCI resources with EHRs, with all reporting them being currently available as embedded links that launch externally. Some recommended that further integration would allow us to leverage existing POCI tool features, such as chatbots and knowledge links, as well as aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as predictive algorithms and personalized alert systems, to enhance EHR functionality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants favored integration to improve usability and optimize workplace efficiency by reducing the amount of time spent seeking answers to their medication- and disease-related questions. Recommendations on integration highlighted the need for stakeholder input in developing clinical decision support tools and interfaces that leverage advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning while not compromising user experience or increasing time spent on tasks.", "authors": ["Marceau Marlika", "Dulgarian Sevan", "Cambre Jacob", "Garabedian Pamela M", "Amato Mary G", "Seger Diane L", "Volk Lynn A", "Jackson Gretchen Purcell", "Bates David W", "Rozenblum Ronen", "Syrowatka Ania"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "臨床醫師對於照護點資訊資源的態度和認知及其與電子健康紀錄整合：一項質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究探討了臨床醫師對於在臨床實務中使用照護點資訊資源（POCI）的看法，以及將這些資源整合到電子健康紀錄（EHR）中的價值。研究團隊在波士頓Brigham and Women's Hospital訪談了10位不同職位和專科的臨床醫師。研究發現，UpToDate是最受歡迎的疾病資訊資源，而藥物資訊資源的選擇則較為分散。醫師們偏好內容全面、排版清晰的POCI工具，但認為文字過於密集、缺乏引用以及頻繁登入等問題會影響使用體驗。多數醫師使用手機App來快速搜尋資訊，但也面臨更新頻繁、登入耗時等挑戰。大家普遍支持將POCI資源與EHR進一步整合，以提升可用性、減少尋找資訊的時間，並建議利用人工智慧和機器學習技術來強化EHR的功能。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果醫生在看診時，需要的藥物資訊或疾病知識，不用再花時間翻書或上網查，而是直接在電腦系統裡就能快速找到，就像有個隨身醫療百科全書一樣，這就能幫助醫生更有效率地做出正確的診斷和治療。", "如果你今天去看醫生，醫生可以透過整合的系統，快速了解最新的治療方法和藥物資訊，這表示你接受到的醫療照護是與時俱進的，不會因為醫生太忙或資訊落後而延誤病情。", "醫院可以利用這個研究結果，設計出更好用的電子病歷系統，讓醫生更容易找到需要的資訊，減少錯誤發生的機率，最終提升整體醫療品質，讓病人得到更好的照顧。"], "audio": "audios/40418791.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:41:10.349412"}

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-efficiency of bDMARD dose reduction in patients with AS and apply machine learning to identify key factors influencing disease control.\nMETHODS: This 12-month prospective study, 368 AS patients receiving ≥ 3 months of full-dose bDMARDs were included. Among 215 initial responders (ASDAS < 2.1), 146 underwent dose reduction while 69 continued full-dose therapy. Clinical outcomes such as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) and ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) were assessed, along with cost effectiveness using incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER). Random forest models were developed to predict the achievement of inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) and to identify key predictors.\nRESULTS: The dose reduction group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in CRP (-4.05 vs. +2.83 mg/L, p < 0.001), BASDAI (-3.00 vs. +0.89, p < 0.001), and ASDAS (-1.42 vs. +0.09, p < 0.001) compared to the full dose group.

Previous studies have described disruption of the norms of academic publishing during this time. This study uses an epidemiological statistical toolkit alongside machine-learning methods to investigate the functioning of the scientific information-generation and -consumption ecosystem throughout the pandemic.\nMETHODS: A dataset of 17 million scientific research papers that were published between January 2019 and December 2022 was analysed. Data on citations and Altmetrics were harvested, and topic modelling was applied to abstracts. COVID-19-related articles were identified from title text. We investigated publication dynamics, correlations between citation metrics and Altmetrics, rates of publication in preprints, and temporal trends in topics, and compared these metrics in COVID-19 papers vs non-COVID-19 papers.\nRESULTS: Throughout 2020-2, 3.7% of English-language research output was on the topic of COVID-19. Journal articles on COVID-19 were published at a consistent rate during this period, while preprints peaked in early 2020 and decreased thereafter. COVID-19 preprints had lower publication rates in the peer-reviewed literature than other preprints, particularly those that were preprinted during early 2020. COVID-19 research received significantly more media and social media attention than non-COVID-19 research, and preprints received more attention, on average, than journal articles, with attention peaking during the initial wave and subsequent peaks corresponding to the emergence of novel variants. COVID-19 articles exhibited a higher correlation between Altmetrics and citation metrics compared with non-COVID-19 publications, suggesting a strong alignment between scientific and public attention.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of the rapid expansion of COVID-19 research, revealing evolving research areas and waxing and waning public interest across different topics.

Nevertheless, conventional epilepsy seizure detection approaches face difficulties such as poor epilepsy seizure detection accuracy and higher computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a novel TransseizNet framework for epilepsy seizure detection from the electroencephalography signal.\nMETHODS: The electroencephalography data from three datasets are pre-processed using the Savitzky-Golay filter. The proposed framework utilizes the Empirical Tunable Q-Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition, which is the combination of the Empirical Wavelet Transform and the Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform. This enhances time-frequency resolution and adaptively captures localized oscillatory patterns critical for precise seizure detection. The proposed framework utilizes a Wavelet-Graph Convolutional Network Vision Transformer for epilepsy seizure detection and classification. The integration of wavelet-driven attention with graph-based learning enhances spatial-temporal feature representation, which makes seizure detection more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient than the baseline approaches.\nRESULTS: The TransseizNet model is trained and validated on three datasets and achieves an average accuracy of 98.65% a precision of 98.59%, a F1-score of 98.45%, a recall of 98.30%, a specificity of 98.52%, a computational time of 17 sec, and the detection latency of 2.5 sec, which outperforms the performance of baseline approaches in the detection of epileptic seizures.\nDISCUSSION: TransseizNet framework provides superior performance in seizure detection by efficiently integrating adaptive frequency decomposition and hybrid deep learning.

However, cancer researchers still face a significant challenge in accurately predicting breast cancer patients' survival rates. The purpose was to predict breast cancer survival using a Bayesian network.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 2,995 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently hospitalized between January 1, 2012, and December 30, 2024. SPSS Modeler version 18.0 was used to build prediction models. The data were randomly split into a training set (2,097 cases, 70%) and a test set (898 cases, 30%) for developing the Bayesian network model and predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The model included demographic variables (age, marital status, and governorate), laboratory/clinical variables (hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, presence of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) and the outcome variable, patient survival status (binary value: survived/died). The discriminative ability of models was evaluated by accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) in terms of superior predictive performance for breast cancer outcomes.\nRESULTS: The Bayesian model exhibited the best discriminatory performance among the nine models, with an AUC of 0.859 and the highest accuracy of 96.661%. In the context of feature importance, white blood cell value at the time of diagnosis was the most important feature for predicting the survival of breast cancer. Patients who had below-normal hemoglobin and above-normal white blood count values had a higher death probability than patients who had normal white blood count and hemoglobin values. The presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with breast cancer led to a reduced survival probability.\nCONCLUSION: The Bayesian model outperformed the other models in predicting the survival probability of breast cancer.

However, prenatal screening is prone to inaccuracies, leading to potentially unnecessary interventions. This study aims to evaluate the factors influencing the accuracy of third-trimester screening for LGA fetuses to improving diagnostic accuracy.\nMETHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted involving low-risk pregnancies from three hospitals. Screening was analyzed using ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC) and symphysial fundal height (SFH) measurements. EFW and AC were assessed either during the routine third-trimester ultrasound or during an additional growth ultrasound when available. Newborns were classified as LGA based on AUDIPOG growth curves. Screening performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), Youden's index and accuracy. We also evaluated composite screening tests combining biometric parameters with maternal clinical risk factors and influence of gestational age at the time of growth ultrasound to identify the optimal timing for screening.\nRESULTS: Among 2,217 women, risk factors such as high BMI and gestational diabetes increased suspicion of LGA fetuses, contributing to both true and false positive results (p<0.001). No single ultrasound parameter demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. Third-trimester ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 37 % [31-44 %] and a specificity of 94 % [93-95 %], while growth ultrasound improved sensitivity to 65 % [57-74 %] but reduced specificity to 82 % [79-85 %]. SFH measurements did not enhance screening performance. Overestimation of fetal weight was observed in 56.89 % (95/167) of cases, with errors exceeding 10 % in 26.95 % (122/167) of newborns. Combined screening using fetal biometry and maternal clinical risk factors showed high specificity but poor sensitivity, limiting their utility as standalone tools for detecting macrosomia.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the impact of operator bias in LGA screening, with risk factors influencing measurements. The modest performance of ultrasound-based screening highlights the inherent limitations of current methods.

Among them, the control group used videos for skill acquisition, and the ChatGPT group used ChatGPT in addition to the videos. After 1 week of intervention, skills were tested using desktop virtual reality, and cognitive load was measured by recording changes in pupil diameter with an eye tracker. In addition, a spatial ability test was administered to analyze the effect of ChatGPT on those with different spatial abilities. Finally, a questionnaire was also used to assess cognitive load and self-efficacy during the learning process.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 dental undergraduates from a top-tier Chinese university were initially recruited for the experiment by October 25, 2024.

While deep learning techniques improve the accuracy of segmentation, traditional voxel-based segmentation and surface reconstruction pipelines tend to introduce artifacts such as disconnected regions, topological inconsistencies, and stepped distortions. To overcome these challenges, we propose ToPoMesh, an end-to-end 3D mesh reconstruction deep learning framework for direct reconstruction of high-fidelity surface meshes from CT volume data. To address the existing problems, our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) accurate local and global shape modeling by preserving and enhancing local feature information through residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks; (2) an adaptive variant density (Avd) mesh de-pooling strategy, which dynamically optimizes the vertex distribution; (3) a topology modification module that iteratively prunes the error surfaces and boundary smoothing via variable regularity terms to obtain finer mesh surfaces. Experiments on the LiTS, MSD pancreas tumor, MSD hippocampus, and MSD spleen datasets demonstrate that ToPoMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate a 57.4% reduction in Chamfer distance (liver) and a 0.47% improvement in F-score compared to end-to-end 3D reconstruction methods, while qualitative results confirm enhanced fidelity for thin structures and complex anatomical topologies versus segmentation frameworks.

During phase 1, participants received an online weight loss program. Those who achieved 5% or greater weight loss in phase 1 were eligible for phase 2, the actual 18-month WLM trial. Participants in the maintenance trial were randomized to either an entirely patient-delivered lifestyle intervention for WLM or SOC delivered by professional staff.

Nevertheless, its comprehensive roles in pan-cancer progression, underlying biological functions, and potential as a predictor of immunotherapy response remains poorly understood.\nMETHODS: We performed a comprehensive multi-omics pan-cancer analysis of CCT5 across 33 cancer types, integrating bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics data. CCT5 expression patterns, prognostic relevance, stemness association, and immune microenvironment relationships were evaluated. A novel CCT5-based signature (CCT5.Sig) was developed using machine learning on 23 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohorts (n = 1394) spanning eight cancer types. Model performance was assessed using AUC metrics and survival analyses.\nRESULTS: CCT5 was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues and primarily localized to malignant and cycling cells. High CCT5 expression correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers and was enriched in oncogenic, cell cycle, and DNA damage repair pathways. CCT5 expression was positively associated with mRNAsi, mDNAsi, and CytoTRACE scores, indicating a role in stemness maintenance.

If patients' seizures localize to a discrete brain region, termed a seizure onset zone, resection may be curative. Localization is often confirmed with stereotactic electroencephalography; however, this may require patients to stay in the hospital for weeks to capture spontaneous seizures. Automated localization of seizure onset zones could therefore improve presurgical evaluation and decrease morbidity.\nMETHODS: Using more than 1 000 000 interictal stereotactic electroencephalography segments collected from 78 patients, we performed five-fold cross-validation and testing on a multichannel, multiscale, one-dimensional convolutional neural network to classify seizure onset zones.\nRESULTS: Across held-out test sets, our models achieved a seizure onset zone classification sensitivity of .702 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .549-.805), specificity of .741 (95% CI = .652-.835), and accuracy of .738 (95% CI = .687-.795), which was significantly better than models trained on random labels. The models performed well across the entire brain, with top five region performance demonstrating accuracies between 70.0% and 88.4%. When split by outcomes, the models performed significantly better on patients with favorable Engel outcomes after resection or who were responsive neurostimulation responders. Finally, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) value analysis on median-normalized input data assigned consistently high feature importance to interictal spikes and large deflections, whereas similar analyses on histogram-equalized data revealed differences in feature importance assignments to low-amplitude segments.\nSIGNIFICANCE: This work serves as evidence that deep learning on brief interictal intracranial data can classify seizure onset zones across the brain.

However, public attitudes toward AI, including trust and risk perception, are key to its ethical and effective adoption. Despite growing interest, empirical research on the factors shaping public support for AI in health care (particularly in large-scale, representative contexts) remains limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate public attitudes toward AI in patient health care, focusing on how AI attributes (autonomy, costs, reliability, and transparency) shape perceptions of support, risk, and personalized care. In addition, it examines the moderating role of sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, educational level, migration background, and subjective health status) in these evaluations. Our study offers novel insights into the relative importance of AI system characteristics for public attitudes and acceptance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a factorial vignette experiment with a probability-based survey of 3030 participants from Germany's general population. Respondents were presented with hypothetical scenarios involving AI applications in diagnosis and treatment in a hospital setting. Linear regression models assessed the relative influence of AI attributes on the dependent variables (support, risk perception, and personalized care), with additional subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity by sociodemographic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Mean values between 4.2 and 4.4 on a 1-7 scale indicate a generally neutral to slightly negative stance toward AI integration in terms of general support, risk perception, and personalized care expectations, with responses spanning the full scale from strong support to strong opposition. Among the 4 dimensions, reliability emerges as the most influential factor (percentage of explained variance [EV] of up to 10.5%). Respondents expect AI to not only prevent errors but also exceed current reliability standards while strongly disapproving of nontraceable systems (transparency is another important factor, percentage of EV of up to 4%). Costs and autonomy play a comparatively minor role (percentage of EVs of up to 1.5% and 1.3%), with preferences favoring collaborative AI systems over autonomous ones, and higher costs generally leading to rejection. Heterogeneity analysis reveals limited sociodemographic differences, with education and migration background influencing attitudes toward transparency and autonomy, and gender differences primarily affecting cost-related perceptions. Overall, attitudes do not substantially differ between AI applications in diagnosis versus treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study fills a critical research gap by identifying the key factors that shape public trust and acceptance of AI in health care, particularly reliability, transparency, and patient-centered approaches.

Models using pre-vaccination antibody haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres against the vaccine strain alone poorly predict post-vaccination responses.\nMETHODS: We combined fifteen prior H3N2 influenza vaccine studies from 1997 to 2021, collectively containing 20,000 data points, and develop of a machine learning model that uses pre-vaccination HAI titres against multiple influenza variants to predict post-vaccination responses. To further test the model, four new vaccine studies were conducted in 2022-2023 spanning two geographic locations and three influenza vaccine types.\nFINDINGS: The most predictive pre-vaccination features were HAI titres against the vaccine strain and against historical influenza variants, with smaller predictive power derived from age, sex, vaccine dose, and geographic location. The resulting model predicted future responses even when the vaccine strain or vaccine formulation changed. A pre-vaccination feature-the time between peak HAI across recent variants-distinguished large versus small post-vaccination responses with 73% accuracy. Model predictions against prior vaccine studies had 2.4-fold error (95% CI: 2.34-2.40x, no large outliers with >4-fold error), yielding more accurate and robust predictions than a null model with 3.2-fold error (95% CI: 3.12-3.21x, 12% large outliers). The four new vaccine studies presented here were predicted with comparable accuracy to the intrinsic 2-fold error of the experimental assay.\nINTERPRETATION: A person's pre-vaccination influenza HAI titres using multiple variants are highly predictive of their post-vaccination response. Many individuals exhibited little-to-no vaccine response, as exhibited by the null model's accuracy, yet the machine learning model identified and accurately predicted both weak and strong responses with statistical superiority.

China's rapid technological adoption, large population, and supportive government policies position it as a potential global leader in DTx. However, challenges remain in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, product development, and reimbursement models. A comprehensive assessment of clinical evidence, commercialization trends, and regulatory frameworks is essential for understanding China's evolving DTx ecosystem and its global implications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews and analyzes the DTx landscape in China, focusing on clinical trials, commercial products, regulatory frameworks, and pricing and reimbursement models. The findings provide insights for countries aiming to develop, regulate, and integrate DTx solutions into health care systems.\nMETHODS: This comprehensive review integrates multiple methodological approaches to examine different aspects of the DTx ecosystem in China. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate clinical trials, searching PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until July 2024. Meta-analyses used random-effects models, reporting results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. For commercial products, a scoping review using the National Medical Products Administration database was performed. Regulatory policies were systematically identified through a manual review of official government sources, while pricing and reimbursement models were analyzed through a comprehensive assessment of public and private insurance policies, government initiatives, and commercial pathways.\nRESULTS: : A total of 96 clinical trials on DTx in China were identified, with cognitive disorders (n=21, 22%) and diabetes (n=20, 21%) being the most frequently studied, followed by cardiovascular diseases (n=8, 8%), sleeping disorders (n=6, 6%), and smoking cessation (n=6, 6%). Meta-analysis for diabetes DTx showed a trend toward improved hemoglobin A1c levels in digital intervention groups compared to controls (SMD -0.96, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.11) but did not reach statistical significance (I²=97%). Meta-analysis for cognitive disorder DTx showed significant improvement in global cognitive function in DTx-treated participants (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-0.94), despite notable heterogeneity (I²=71.7%). The commercial landscape analysis identified 97 active DTx solutions, primarily targeting cognitive impairment (38 companies), ophthalmic diseases (30 companies), and respiratory diseases (5 companies). The regulatory review highlighted China's reliance on general medical device policies under the National Medical Products Administration rather than DTx-specific regulations, with emerging regional innovation policies supporting industry growth. Pricing analysis revealed diverse reimbursement models, including value-based pricing, private insurance partnerships, and government-facilitated programs.\nCONCLUSIONS: China has made substantial progress in DTx development but still faces challenges in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, and reimbursement. Key factors driving DTx adoption include targeted indications, standardized clinical trials, streamlined regulation, and diversified pricing models. China's experience provides valuable lessons for other countries with emerging digital health ecosystems as they develop DTx research, regulations, and integration strategies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42024615584; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024615584.", "authors": ["Jiang Nan", "Yu Xiru", "Yang Yuxi", "Li Guanqiao", "He Chanchan", "Wang Man Ping", "Tham Yih Chung", "Wong Tien Yin", "Rao Keqin"], "published_date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "中國的數位療法：綜合回顧", "summary_zh": "數位療法(DTx)是透過軟體提供個人化、實證治療的創新方法。中國在數位療法領域具有巨大潛力，擁有龐大人口、快速發展的科技以及政府的支持政策。本研究全面回顧了中國數位療法的發展現況，包括臨床試驗、商業產品、法規框架以及定價與報銷模式。研究發現，中國在認知障礙和糖尿病等領域的數位療法臨床試驗數量最多，並在改善認知功能方面顯示出顯著效果。目前中國數位療法主要依賴現有的醫療器材法規，但各地區也開始出現支持產業發展的創新政策。儘管中國在數位療法發展上取得顯著進展，但在臨床試驗標準化、法規批准和報銷方面仍面臨挑戰。本研究結果可為其他國家發展數位療法提供寶貴經驗。", "applications": ["想像一下，阿茲海默症的早期患者，不用每天跑醫院，透過手機App就能進行認知訓練，延緩病情惡化，這就是數位療法帶來的便利。", "糖尿病患者常常需要頻繁監測血糖和調整飲食，現在透過數位療法App，可以獲得個人化的飲食建議和運動計畫，幫助他們更好地控制血糖，減少併發症的風險。", "有些小朋友有注意力不足過動症(ADHD)，透過數位遊戲，可以訓練他們的專注力，改善學習效率，而且是在輕鬆有趣的環境下進行，讓治療不再枯燥乏味。"], "audio": "audios/40424619.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T01:19:29.690839"}

FGR in patients with preeclampsia increases the risk of neonatal-perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, previous prediction methods for FGR are class-biased or clinically unexplainable, which makes it difficult to apply to clinical practice, leading to a relative delay in intervention and a lack of effective treatments.\nOBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop an auxiliary diagnostic model based on machine learning (ML) to predict the occurrence of FGR in patients with preeclampsia.\nMETHODS: This study used a retrospective case-control approach to analyze 38 features, including the basic medical history and peripheral blood laboratory test results of pregnant patients with preeclampsia, either complicated or not complicated by FGR. ML models were constructed to evaluate the predictive value of maternal parameter changes on preeclampsia combined with FGR. Multiple algorithms were tested, including logistic regression, light gradient boosting, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, and support vector machine. The model performance was identified by the area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation indexes. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was adopted to rank the feature importance and explain the final model for clinical application.\nRESULTS: The RF model performed best in discriminative ability among the 7 ML models. After reducing features according to importance rank, an explainable final RF model was established with 9 features, including urinary protein quantification, gestational week of delivery, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, amniotic fluid index, triglyceride, D-dimer, weight, height, and maximum systolic pressure. The model could accurately predict FGR for 513 patients with preeclampsia (149 with FGR and 364 without FGR) in the training and testing dataset (AUC 0.83, SD 0.03) using 5-fold cross-validation, which was closely validated for 103 patients with preeclampsia (n=45 with FGR and n=58 without FGR) in an external dataset (AUC 0.82, SD 0.048). On the whole, urinary protein quantification, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, and gestational week of delivery exhibited the highest contributions to the model performance (c=0.45, 0.34, and 0.33) based on SHAP analysis. For specific individual patients, SHAP results reveal the protective and risk factors to develop FGR for interpreting the model's clinical significance. Finally, the model has been translated into a convenient web page tool to facilitate its use in clinical settings.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study successfully developed a model that accurately predicts FGR development in patients with preeclampsia.

Existing diabetes apps offer features that enable integrations with various devices that streamline diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps, or regular activity trackers. While this reduces the tracking burden on the users, the research highlighted several issues with diabetes apps, including issues with reliability and trustworthiness. As pumps and continuous glucose monitors are safety-critical systems-where issues can result in serious harm or fatalities-it is important to understand what issues and vulnerabilities could be introduced by relying on popular diabetes apps as an interface for interacting with such devices.\nOBJECTIVE: As there is a lack of research examining in detail the integrations and potential suitability of apps as part of a wider self-management ecosystem, our goal was 2-fold. First, we aimed to understand the current landscape of device integrations within diabetes apps and how well they meet users' needs. Second, we identified the key issues users of the most popular apps face currently and what features are the source of these issues.\nMETHODS: Through searches in Android and iPhone app stores, we systematically identified 21 diabetes apps that offer integrations.

This study introduces a rigorous multivariate time series analysis, integrating meteorological factors with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, to predict DENV case trends across different temporal scales. Leveraging a robust data pipeline, this research incorporates a strategic downscaling technique, applying the Stochastic Bayesian Downscaling (SBD) algorithm to convert monthly DENV case data to daily frequency. This approach addresses key issues in the handling of sparse datasets and missing data, offering novel insights into the potential accuracy benefits of data downscaling in time series forecasting. Among the models assessed, the decision tree demonstrated superior performance on the actual monthly data, achieving an accuracy of 74.6 %  . In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of 95.8 %  , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a 28.5 %  improvement in accuracy and an 89.3 %  reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting.

Timely and precise detection of various stages of cervical cancer plays a crucial role in enhancing the chances of successful treatment and extending patient survival.

In our study, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Grassmann manifold (GM) learning are explored for reliable cancer detection using fluorescence spectral signals collected from 110 subjects representing various categories of the human cervix. Initially, EMD is used to decompose the signal into several multi-feature intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) on a spectral scale. Each IMF demonstrates uniqueness by capturing the inherent frequency characteristics within the signal, thus facilitating the extraction of signal features. The GM representation of IMFs is employed for investigating the non-linear subspace structure within spectral signals, which is subsequently followed by a low-rank representation to transform and analyze the spectral signals. The GM allows for the extraction of relevant information, reduction of dimensionality, and exploration of complex relationships within data, ultimately contributing to improved diagnosis. Mutual information is further used for feature selection to reduce the number of features and hence the computational cost.

Continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems have enhanced the quality of life and glycemic outcomes while reducing severe hypoglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis hospitalizations. Despite these benefits, racial inequities in the use of advanced diabetes technology (ADT) persist.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate a best practice advisory (BPA) within the electronic medical record (EMR) to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in ADT use. We hypothesize that an EMR-based BPA designed to standardize the prescribing of ADTs will minimize racial and ethnic disparities in ADT adoption or progression in use among pediatric and adult people with type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: The Best Practice Advisories to Reduce Inequities in Technology Use (BPA-TECH) study will use a nonrandomized matched pair intervention design. Phase 1 will use qualitative methods to develop and refine the BPA, including focus groups and surveys of health care providers and people with type 1 diabetes or their caregivers. Phase 2 will evaluate the effectiveness of the BPA through a controlled before-after study of people with type 1 diabetes seen at 7 T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) centers, with control people with type 1 diabetes matched from nonintervention T1DX-QI centers. The baseline and postintervention periods will be the 12 months before and 12 months after deployment of the BPA at the intervention centers, respectively. Eligibility criteria include people with type 1 diabetes aged ≥2 years with an EMR diagnosis of T1D during the baseline period. The primary outcome is the progression in ADT use from the baseline to postintervention periods.\nRESULTS: This 3-year study began in July 2024, with data collection from key stakeholders for phase 1 qualitative research beginning in August 2024. For phase 2, we estimate approximately 3000 eligible non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic people with type 1 diabetes at the intervention centers and 15,000 matched controls. Data on ADT use, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), severe hypoglycemic events, and diabetes ketoacidosis events will be collected via the T1DX-QI coordinating center. The study is powered to detect a between-group difference of 15% in the proportion of patients in the intervention and control groups in meeting the primary endpoint.

With a population of 148.88 million, India holds the world's largest goat population, comprising 41 recognized indigenous breeds. These goats provide milk, meat, and fiber, particularly in marginal environments. The genomic advancements in goat research have revolutionized the understanding of genetic diversity, adaptation, and trait improvement. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and transcriptomics have unveiled genetic markers associated with production, disease resistance, and reproductive traits. Genomic tools such as the Illumina Goat SNP50K BeadChip and high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of selection signatures and quantitative trait loci (QTL), influencing economically important traits like milk yield, meat quality, and prolificacy. Notably, genes such as DGAT1, GHR, BMPR1B, and HSP70 have been linked to production efficiency, reproductive performance, and climate resilience. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) have enabled precision breeding, enhancing genetic gains and reducing inbreeding risks. The application of RNA sequencing has provided insights into gene expression patterns governing lactation, growth, and reproductive efficiency. Epigenomic studies, focusing on DNA methylation and histone modifications, have highlighted regulatory mechanisms underpinning prolificacy and muscle development. Conservation genomics has played a pivotal role in safeguarding native breeds by assessing genetic diversity and mitigating inbreeding depression. Indicine goat breeds, such as Jamunapari, Beetal, Barbari, and Black Bengal, exhibit unique genetic adaptations to diverse agro-climatic conditions, emphasizing the need for their conservation. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, hold promise for precision breeding to enhance productivity and disease resistance.

In a recent study, our all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a nonlinearly large electroosmotic (EOS) flow (in the presence of an applied electric field) in nanochannels grafted with PMETAC [poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride] brushes. Given the lack of any formal procedure that would have directed us to identify the correct factors responsible for such an occurrence, we needed to devote several months to unraveling the involved mechanisms. In this letter, we propose a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based machine learning (ML) approach to address this gap. At first, we obtained data on certain basic features from the all-atom MD data. These basic features represent the number of atoms of a certain species around one atom of another (or the same) species. We obtain such data on basic features for a reference case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a smaller electric field) and a perturbed case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a larger electric field) in bins into which the nanochannel half height has been divided. These data sets are high-dimensional data sets to which the LDA is applied. This leads to the projection of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) in a highly separated form on a 1D line. From such LDA calculations, we can identify the relative importance of the different basic features in ensuring this separation of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) on the 1D line. The relative importance of the different basic features is quantified as \"importance scores\" for the different features, which, in turn, tell us what to study and where to study.

Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates between groups. The primary outcome was incident delirium; secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess outcomes.\nRESULTS: After matching, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of delirium compared with metformin (ARR 5.03%, 3.97% vs. 9.0%; aHR 0.91 [95% CI 0.87, 0.95], P < 0.001).

While the digitalization of health care, including telemedicine and artificial intelligence, offers sustainability benefits, it also raises concerns about energy use and electronic waste. Balancing these factors is key to a sustainable health care future.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to examine the extent to which digitalization in the health care sector influences environmental sustainability. Specifically, it aimed to assess how digitalization can contribute to reducing the health care sector's impact on global climate change. From these findings, conclusions were drawn regarding the extent to which digitalization aligns with the objectives of the Planetary Health movement and how these 2 movements may mutually reinforce each other.\nMETHODS: A scoping review guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines using databases such as PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and 58 quantitative studies from 2009 to 2024 were analyzed for environmental, social, and economic outcomes aligned with Planetary Health goals.\nRESULTS: This review analyzed 58 studies on the environmental impact of digitalization in health care primarily focusing on telemedicine, which was examined in 91% (53/58) of the studies. Most studies (56/58, 97%) quantified transport-related emissions avoided through digitalization, with some also assessing emissions from health care facilities, medical equipment, and energy consumption. Findings indicated that telemedicine significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions, with total avoided emissions amounting to approximately 830 million kg. A substantial proportion of the studies (36/58, 62%) focused on social aspects, highlighting factors such as patient satisfaction, time efficiency, and overall convenience. In addition, economic considerations were analyzed in 48% (28/58) of the studies, emphasizing cost reductions and resource optimization. However, only 12% (7/58) of the studies evaluated the full life cycle impact of digital technologies, highlighting the need for further research on their long-term environmental sustainability.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review calls for further research beyond telemedicine, advocating for life cycle analyses and actionable strategies for a sustainable digitalization in health care systems.

Furthermore, our functional assays revealed that OVOL1 enhances the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Although ossification in tendon tissue has been reported in a range of aging and disease models, the underlying biomarkers and mechanisms remain unknown. And the characterisation and sensitivity of previous diagnostic biomarkers for tendon ectopic ossification do not meet the demands of clinical use. The aim of this study was to characterise the effects of aging on ossification in the mouse Achilles tendon and to identify characteristic genes and therapeutic targets for tendon ossification in mice by using a machine learning approach.\nMETHODS: We retrieved the transcriptome profile of GSE126118 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Following background correction and normalization using the transcripts per million (TPM) method, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the limma R package (p < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1). Subsequently, 468 senescence genes were downloaded from the Aging Atlas database, and senescence-associated DEGs (HO senescence genes) were identified. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted on the identified DEGs. To further refine the HO aging signature, support vector machine (SVM) regression was employed. Additionally, we predicted transcription factors, miRNAs, and small molecule drugs potentially associated with the characterized genes.\nRESULTS: Three characterised genes were identified as biomarkers associated with ectopic ossification and aging in the mouse Achilles tendon, Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment in processes related to cartilage endochondral ossification, metalloendopeptidase activity, and mitochondrial proton transport ATP synthase complex. Additionally, HIF-1 and GnRH signaling pathways were prominently represented among the differentially expressed genes.\nCONCLUSION: Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13 were identified as relevant signature genes for the effects of aging on Achilles tendon ossification in mice. Atp5o, Mmp2, and Mmp13 may influence tendon ossification by affecting mitochondrial function as well as extracellular matrix degradation to regulate senescence.

Despite this, access to care is still poor. This study aimed to assess barriers/facilitators to access NCDs services for children, adolescents and young people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in Mozambique.\nMETHODS: A qualitative cross-sectional study using focus groups (FG) and key-informant interviews was conducted between September and October 2023, involving patients (16-30 years), caregivers of child and adolescent patients and health care staff of 5 health facilities. A deductive approach was adopted using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework to classify themes referring to barriers/facilitators to access. Two researchers carried out quantitative content analysis independently, assessing the inter-rater agreement through Cohen's K.\nRESULTS: Four FGs were conducted with 26 patients (61.5% female, 16-24 years), three with 18 caregivers (83.3% female) and 16 interviews with healthcare workers. A total of 455 themes were identified, with a predominance of barriers (67.3%) compared to facilitators (32.7%) in accessing T1DM services. The area ''Capability'' was labelled significantly more often as a barrier (89.5%) than ''Motivation'' and ''Opportunities'' (60.2% and 62.6%, p < 0.001). The most frequent barriers were related to the psychological ability to accept and manage the disease in the absence of professional psychological support, inadequate interactions with healthcare personnel, long waits in the outpatient clinic and stigma towards diabetes in the community. Social support from family and friends appears to be an important facilitator.

TGFβ is a promising target due to its significant involvement in the desmoplasia, immune suppression, and chemoresistance characteristic of pancreatic cancer. Over 300 clinical trials targeting TGFβ have been conducted in unselected patient cohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval. Nevertheless, TGFβ blockade may hold promise for a subset of cancers with non-functional TGFβ signaling. Greater than 25% of pancreatic cancers carry mutations in SMAD4, a key component of canonical TGFβ signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify tumors susceptible to TGFβ inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human pancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse disease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed heterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited reduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and protein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, treating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGFβ antibody reduced tumor weight and improved survival.

The robustness of the MFM-clustering algorithm was validated, offering enhanced pollutant classification accuracy compared to conventional statistical methods by focusing on pollutant-specific features. We used a systematic framework comprising field investigations, target screening, risk assessment, and MFM-clustering-based source analysis. The methodology was applied to the Bohai Sea, China, as a case study, where 29 OPEs, including 15 eOPEs, were quantified in sediment samples. This application refined the clustering analysis and enabled detailed ecological risk assessments. Industries associated with OPEs production, sewage treatment plants, industrial discharges, surface runoff from automotive activities, atmospheric transport of volatile OPEs, and petroleum-related operations for most eOPEs have been identified as key contributors to OPE pollution in various regions of the Bohai Sea.

However, accurately grading IBC presents a significant challenge due to its heterogeneous nature and the need to harness the complementary information from multiple nuclei sources in histopathology images. To tackle this critical problem, we introduce a novel multi-source hybrid feature fusion network named MSFusion. This network incorporates two types of hybrid features: deep learning features extracted by a novel Swin Transformer-based multi-branch network called MSwinT, and traditional handcrafted features that capture the morphological characteristics of multi-source nuclei. The primary branch of MSwinT captures the overall characteristics of the original images, while multiple auxiliary branches focus on identifying morphological features from diverse sources of nuclei, including tumor, mitotic, tubular, and epithelial nuclei. At each of the four stages for the branches in MSwinT, a functional KDC (key diagnostic components) fusion block with channel and spatial attentions is proposed to integrate the features extracted by all the branches. Ultimately, we synthesize the multi-source hybrid deep learning features and handcrafted features to improve the accuracy of IBC diagnosis and grading. Our multi-branch MSFusion network is rigorously evaluated on three distinct datasets, including two private clinical datasets (Qilu dataset and QDUH&SHSU dataset) as well as a publicly available Databiox dataset.

It is widely utilized for examining various organs, such as the breast, thyroid, ovary, cardiac, and more. However, the manual interpretation and annotation of ultrasound images are time-consuming and prone to variability among physicians. While single-task artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored, they are not ideal for scaling AI applications in medical imaging. Foundation models, although a trending solution, often struggle with real-world medical datasets due to factors such as noise, variability, and the incapability of flexibly aligning prior knowledge with task adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose an orchestration learning framework named PerceptGuide for general-purpose ultrasound classification and segmentation. Our framework incorporates a novel orchestration mechanism based on prompted hyper-perception, which adapts to the diverse inductive biases required by different ultrasound datasets. Unlike self-supervised pre-trained models, which require extensive fine-tuning, our approach leverages supervised pre-training to directly capture task-relevant features, providing a stronger foundation for multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound imaging. To support this research, we compiled a large-scale Multi-task, Multi-organ public ultrasound dataset (M2-US), featuring images from 9 organs and 16 datasets, encompassing both classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach employs four specific prompts-Object, Task, Input, and Position-to guide the model, ensuring task-specific adaptability. Additionally, a downstream synchronization training stage is introduced to fine-tune the model for new data, significantly improving generalization capabilities and enabling real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our framework in handling multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound image processing, outperforming both specialist models and existing general AI solutions.

Currently, DCIS that might progress to IBC cannot reliably be identified. Therefore, most patients with DCIS undergo treatment resembling IBC. To facilitate identification of low-risk DCIS, we developed deep learning models using histology whole-slide images (WSIs) and clinico-pathological data.\nMETHODS: We predicted invasive recurrence in patients with primary, pure DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery using clinical Cox proportional hazards models and deep learning. Deep learning models were trained end-to-end with only WSIs or in combination with clinical data (integrative). We employed nested k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) on a Dutch multicentre dataset (n = 558). Models were also tested on the UK-based Sloane dataset (n = 94).\nFINDINGS: Evaluated over 20 years on the Dutch dataset, deep learning models using only WSIs effectively stratified patients into low-risk (no recurrence) and high-risk (invasive recurrence) groups (negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.83); hazard ratio (HR) = 4.48 (95% CI: 3.41-5.88, p < 0.0001); area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79)).

Furthermore, external validation of the models was unsuccessful, limited by the small size and low number of cases (22/94) in our external dataset, WSI quality, as well as the lack of well-annotated datasets that allow robust validation.\nINTERPRETATION: Deep learning models using routinely processed WSIs hold promise for DCIS risk stratification, while the benefits of integrating clinical data merit further investigation.

An important step involved in brachytherapy is the delineation of organs at risk (OARs) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Automating OARs segmentation in brachytherapy has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of radiation therapy planning. This paper introduces a novel segmentation model named MFFUNet for the automatic contour delineation of OARs in cervical cancer brachytherapy. The proposed model employs a staged encoder-decoder structure, integrating the self-attention mechanism of Transformer with the CNN framework. A novel multi-features fusion (MFF) block with a cross-attention-guided feature fusion mechanism is also proposed, which efficiently extracts and cross-fuses features from multiple receptive fields, enriching the semantic information of the features and thus improving the performance of complex segmentation tasks. A private CT image dataset of 95 patients with cervical cancer undergoing brachytherapy is used to evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed method. The OARs in the data consist of the bladder, rectum, and colon surrounding the cervix. The proposed model surpasses current mainstream OARs segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy. The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of all three OARs has achieved 73.69%. Among them, the DSC score for the bladder is 92.65%, for the rectum is 66.55%, and for the colon is 61.86%. Moreover, we also conducted experiments on two common public thoracoabdominal multi-organ CT datasets.

Using flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assays, we demonstrated a significant decrease in cytotoxicity and activation of NK92 cells against BCa upon CD56 deletion. Further, migration assays and atomic force microscopy showed CD56 deletion impaired NK92 cell migration and adhesion to bladder tumor cells, reducing NK92 cell-mediated apoptosis of BCa cells. Prolonged exposure to bladder tumors led to CD56 loss in NK92 cells, suggesting tumor-induced NK92 cell dysfunction via CD56 reduction, consistent with our previous findings. Confocal microscopy revealed an overlap of CD56 and phosphorylated Pyk2, a critical kinase at the tumor-immune synapse, potentially mediating the downstream cytotoxicity effects. Blocking Pyk2 phosphorylation decreased CD56-mediated NK92 cell activation and reduced NK92 cell-mediated cytotoxicity against BCa.

Recent studies highlight its unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms, showing that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can activate both the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This leads to a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviation of inflammation. Such neuroimmune regulation provides valuable insights for managing chronic inflammatory diseases, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pneumonia, and Crohn's disease. This review summarizes the functional roles of the vagus nerve in inflammatory diseases and the underlying mechanisms. It discusses how the vagus nerve regulates neural, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders through neurotransmitters, receptors, and anti-inflammatory pathways. Specifically, VNS has been shown to reduce inflammation by releasing acetylcholine, which binds to α7nAChR on immune cells and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both clinical and preclinical studies emphasize the effectiveness of non-invasive VNS in treating conditions such as stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further supporting the vagus nerve's potential as a therapeutic target. This paper also emphasizes the need for future research to better understand the specific mechanisms by which the vagus nerve modulates immune responses. Furthermore, validating the safety and efficacy of VNS through multi-center clinical trials is essential, alongside exploring personalised therapies using advanced biotechnology for precise modulation.

However, its yield is often affected by various leaf diseases. Early identification of maize leaf disease through easily accessible tool is required to increase the yield of maize. Recently, researchers have attempted to detect and classify maize leaf diseases using Deep Learning algorithms. However, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, nearly all the studies are concentrated on developing an offline model that can detect maize diseases. But, those models are not easily accessible to individuals and don't provide immediate feedback and monitoring. Thus, in this study, we developed a novel real-time, user-friendly maize leaf disease detection and classification mobile application. The VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50 models were implemented and compared their performance on maize disease detection and classification. A total of 4188 images of blight, common_rust, grey_leaf_spot, and healthy were used to train each model. Data augmentation techniques were applied to the dataset to increase the size of the dataset, which can also reduce model overfitting. Weighted cross-entropy loss was also employed to mitigate class-imbalance problems. After training, VGG16 achieved 95% of testing accuracy, AlexNet achieved 91%, and ResNet50 achieved 72% of testing accuracy. The VGG16 model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.

However, factors influencing bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in Chinese individuals with T2D remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biochemical determinants of BMD and TBS in patients with T2D, with a focus on elucidating the role of weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) in modulating bone mass and quality in this cohort.\nMETHODS: Data of 161 women and 153 men with T2D collected between July 2022 and March 2023 in Shenzhen, China, were analyzed in our cross-sectional study. Lumbar spine BMD and TBS of all participants were obtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. WWI was defined as waist circumference over the square root of weight.\nRESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that lumbar spine TBS was inversely correlated with age, menopausal status, and WWI in women (p < 0.05). In men, TBS was negatively associated with age and WWI (p < 0.05). For women, glycated hemoglobin A1c positively influenced BMD (p < 0.05), whereas age, diabetic retinopathy, and N-mid osteocalcin were negatively associated. No significant predictors of BMD were identified in the male cohort. For predicting degraded TBS, the optimal WWI cut-offs were 11.257 cm/√kg (S: 61.1%, E: 80.7%) in males and 11.247 cm/√kg (S: 70.3%, E: 71.1%) in females.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight WWI as a novel and potentially more precise indicator of body fat, associated with diminished bone quality rather than solely low bone mass in patients with T2D in China.

Leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator for assessing the growth condition and yield potential of rice, and the traditional methods for obtaining LAI have problems such as low efficiency and large error. With the development of remote sensing technology, unmanned aerial multispectral remote sensing combined with deep learning technology provides a new way for efficient and accurate estimation of LAI in rice.\nRESULTS: In this study, a multispectral camera mounted on a UAV was utilized to acquire rice canopy image data, and rice LAI was uniformly estimated over multiple periods by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models in deep learning. The results showed that the CNN model based on five-band reflectance images (490, 550, 670, 720, and 850 nm) as input after feature screening exhibited high estimation accuracy at different growth stages.

Further, the aim is to assess the potential efficacy of the intervention in reducing maternal and neonatal health complications compared with standard care.\nMETHODS: VALID-II is a two-site, two-arm, non-randomised feasibility intervention study in Thai Binh Province in northern Vietnam with a delayed start for the intervention group. The intervention study is nested in a larger cohort. In total, 2000 pregnant women will be screened for GDM, with an estimated 400 women screening positive according to the World Health Organisation-International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group diagnostic criteria. First, 200 women who screen positive for GDM will be assigned to a control group that will receive standard care. Among the 200 women, 20 will take part in an in-depth ethnographic study along with their family members, and the intervention will be co-created with them. Second, once the intervention has been created, 200 women will be assigned to the intervention group, which will receive the intervention plus standard care. Twenty women and their families from the intervention group will also take part in an ethnographic study.

A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).\nRESULTS: The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate.

Currently, selection of brachytherapy applicators relies on physician's clinical experience, which can lead to variability in treatment quality and outcomes. This study presents a deep learning-based decision-support tool for selecting between interstitial Syed applicators and intracavitary tandem & ovoids applicators.\nAPPROACH: The network architecture consists of six 3D convolutional-pooling-ReLU blocks, followed by a fully connected block. The input to the network includes three channels: a 3D contour mask of clinical target volume (CTV), organs at risk (OAR), and central tandem, and two 3D distance maps of CTV and OAR voxels relative to the tandem's central axis. The network outputs a probability score, indicating the suitability of Syed applicators. Binary cross-entropy loss combined with L1 regularization was used for network training.\nMAIN RESULTS: A retrospective study was performed on 184 LACC patients with 422 instances of applicator insertion. The data was divided into three sets: Dataset-1 of 163 patients with 372 insertions for training and hyperparameter tuning, Dataset-2 of 17 patients with 36 insertions and Dataset-3 of four complex cases with 14 insertions for testing.

However, differences in demographics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes across colon cancer stages and locations between these databases remain incompletely understood. Addressing these disparities is crucial for researchers when selecting the most appropriate registry for survival analysis.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically compare patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates between NCDB and SEER across various tumor locations and disease stages in colon cancer.\nMETHODS: We analyzed patients undergoing surgery for Stages I-IV primary colon cancer (2004-2019), comparing patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates across distinct tumor locations and cancer stages in NCDB and SEER. Our objective was to assess how differences in database structure and sampling methodologies influence reported survival outcomes.\nRESULTS: The study included 777 827 patients (NCDB: 572 196; SEER: 205 631). Proximal colon cancers were more common in older and female patients in both databases, whereas distal colon cancers were more prevalent in younger patients. NCDB contained a slightly higher proportion of Caucasian patients, while SEER had a greater representation of Asian patients. Segmental resections were more frequent in SEER, with the highest weighted difference observed in sigmoid colon cancer (6.16%; 95% CI: 5.78%-6.54%). OS rates were generally comparable across databases, though minor variations were observed at different colonic locations and stages.\nCONCLUSION: Despite differences in sampling techniques and follow-up reporting, NCDB and SEER demonstrated remarkable consistency in survival trends across colon cancer stages and locations. Recognizing these database-specific variations is essential for researchers conducting population-based survival analyses and selecting the most suitable registry for their studies. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE?: This study provides a comprehensive comparison of NCDB and SEER, highlighting how differences in sampling methodologies, follow-up reporting, and patient representation influence overall survival estimates in colon cancer.

However, it is not clearly established how addition of psyllium impacts properties of potato products and starch digestibility. Starch digestion initiates during oral processing, critically affecting its bioavailability. This study aimed to evaluate how psyllium-induced changes in rheological properties, chewing duration, and bolus characteristics alter starch digestibility during habitual mastication in mashed potatoes (MP).\nRESULTS: The incorporation of psyllium into an MP sample containing κ-carrageenan led to significant improvements in mechanical properties, including a 20% increase in hardness and a 15% increase in cohesiveness. Enhanced gel strength was further corroborated by elevated storage (G') and complex (G*) moduli values. These modifications necessitated prolonged chewing to achieve a swallowable bolus. Notably, the psyllium-containing bolus exhibited greater hardness and reduced fragmentation immediately prior to swallowing. Despite its enhanced rigidity, the MP-carrageenan- psyllium bolus was ingested without difficulty, likely attributable to psyllium's cohesiveness-enhancing effects. This combination of increased cohesiveness and diminished fragmentation contributed to a beneficial 20% reduction in starch digestion during mastication of psyllium-enriched MP samples.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that psyllium incorporation into MP can beneficially modulate its textural properties and bolus characteristics, resulting in reduced starch digestion.

Radiologists' evaluations are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing automated approaches often require large CT datasets with predefined image quality assessment (IQA) scores, which often do not align well with clinical evaluations. We aim to develop a reference-free, automated method for CT IQA that closely reflects radiologists' evaluations, reducing the dependency on large annotated datasets.\nAPPROACH: We propose Task-Focused Knowledge Transfer (TFKT), a deep learning-based IQA method leveraging knowledge transfer from task-similar natural image datasets. TFKT incorporates a hybrid convolutional neural network-transformer model, enabling accurate quality predictions by learning from natural image distortions with human-annotated mean opinion scores. The model is pre-trained on natural image datasets and fine-tuned on low-dose computed tomography perceptual image quality assessment data to ensure task-specific adaptability.\nRESULTS: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed TFKT method effectively predicts IQA scores aligned with radiologists' assessments on in-domain datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain clinical pediatric CT exams. The model achieves robust performance without requiring high-dose reference images. Our model is capable of assessing the quality of ∼ 30  CT image slices in a second.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed TFKT approach provides a scalable, accurate, and reference-free solution for CT IQA.

The continuous creation of large volumes of assessment items, in a consistent format and comparatively restricted time, is laborious. The application of technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been tried to address this challenge. A major concern raised is the validity of the information produced by AI tools, and if not properly verified, it can produce inaccurate and therefore inappropriate assessments.\nOBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the content validity and consistency of different AI chatbots in creating single best answer (SBA) questions, a refined format of multiple choice questions better suited to assess higher levels of knowledge, for undergraduate medical students.\nMETHODS: This study followed 3 steps. First, 3 researchers used a unified prompt script to generate 10 SBA questions across 4 chatbot platforms. Second, assessors evaluated the chatbot outputs for consistency by identifying similarities and differences between users and across chatbots. With 3 assessors and 10 learning objectives, the maximum possible score for any individual chatbot was 30. Third, 7 assessors internally moderated the questions using a rating scale developed by the research team to evaluate scientific accuracy and educational quality.\nRESULTS: In response to the prompts, all chatbots generated 10 questions each, except Bing, which failed to respond to 1 prompt. ChatGPT-4 exhibited the highest variation in question generation but did not fully satisfy the \"cover test.\" Gemini performed well across most evaluation criteria, except for item balance, and relied heavily on the vignette for answers but showed a preference for one answer option. Bing scored low in most evaluation areas but generated appropriately structured lead-in questions. SBA questions from GPT-3.5, Gemini, and ChatGPT-4 had similar Item Content Validity Index and Scale Level Content Validity Index values, while the Krippendorff alpha coefficient was low (0.016). Bing performed poorly in content clarity, overall validity, and item construction accuracy. A 2-way ANOVA without replication revealed statistically significant differences among chatbots and domains (P<.05). However, the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant difference) post hoc test showed no significant pairwise differences between individual chatbots, as all comparisons had P values >.05 and overlapping CIs.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI chatbots can aid the production of questions aligned with learning objectives, and individual chatbots have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Therefore, real-time prediction models play a key role in the clinical diagnosis and management of sepsis. However, the existing sepsis prediction models based on artificial intelligence still have limitations, such as poor real-time performance and insufficient interpretation.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective is to develop a real-time sepsis prediction model that integrates high timeliness and clinical interpretability. The model is designed to dynamically predict the risk of sepsis in ICU patients and establish a practical, tailored sepsis prediction platform.\nMETHODS: Within a retrospective analysis framework, the model comprises a real-time prediction module and an interpretability module. The real-time prediction module leverages 3-hour dynamic temporal features derived from 8 noninvasive, real-time physiological indicators: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and blood glucose. Three linear parameters (mean, SD, and endpoint value) were calculated to construct the prediction model using multiple ML algorithms. The interpretability module uses the TreeSHAP (Tree-Based Shapley Additive Explanations) method to enhance model transparency through both individual prediction and global explanations. Further, it added a link between the output interpretation of the explainable artificial intelligence method and its potential physiological or pathophysiological significance, including the relationship among the output interpretation and the patient's hemodynamics, thermoregulatory response, and the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. Finally, a web-based platform was developed to integrate prediction and interpretability functions.\nRESULTS: The sepsis prediction model demonstrated robust performance in the test cohort (224 patients), achieving an accuracy of 0.7 (95% CI 0.68-0.71), precision of 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.71), F1-score of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67-0.70), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74-0.77). The TreeSHAP method effectively visualized feature contributions, enabling clinicians to interpret the model's prediction logic and identify anomalies. The link between the output interpretation of the model and its potential physiological or pathophysiological significance improved the interpretability and credibility of the explainable artificial intelligence method. The web-based platform significantly enhanced clinical utility by providing real-time risk assessment, statistical summaries, trend analysis, and actionable insights.\nCONCLUSIONS: This platform provides real-time dynamic warnings for sepsis risk in critically ill ICU patients, supporting timely clinical decision-making.", "authors": ["Zhang Mingwei", "Zhong Ming", "Cheng Yunzhang", "Zhang Tianyi"], "published_date": "2025-05-30", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "基於即時動態時間特徵的敗血症風險智慧預測平台：設計研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究開發了一個智慧預測平台，旨在即時預測加護病房（ICU）患者罹患敗血症的風險。該平台利用八項非侵入性的生理指標，包括心率、呼吸頻率、血氧飽和度等，並分析這些指標在三小時內的動態變化。透過機器學習演算法，建立高準確度的預測模型。更重要的是，平台採用TreeSHAP方法，提供模型預測結果的可解釋性，讓醫生了解模型判斷的依據，例如哪些生理指標的變化最為關鍵，並將這些變化與患者的生理狀態聯繫起來。最終，研究團隊開發了一個網頁平台，整合了預測和解釋功能，協助醫生即時評估風險、分析趨勢，並做出更明智的臨床決策，以期降低敗血症患者的死亡率。", "applications": ["想像一下，醫院的加護病房裡，有了這個系統，就像有了一個24小時的AI醫生，隨時監控病人的狀況，一旦發現敗血症的風險，就能立即發出警報，讓醫生可以及早介入治療，提高病人的存活率。", "如果你的家人因為手術或其他原因住進了加護病房，醫生可以使用這個平台，更精準地掌握他們的身體狀況，預測敗血症的風險。這樣一來，就能夠防患於未然，避免病情惡化，讓家人可以安心接受治療。", "這個平台不只可以預測敗血症，還可以幫助醫生了解哪些生理指標對於判斷病情最重要。透過分析這些指標，醫生可以更深入地了解敗血症的發病機制，進而開發出更有效的治療方法，造福更多的病人。"], "audio": "audios/40446292.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-31T01:16:36.405198"}

Specifically, within the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) population, HPV vaccination adherence remains a complex issue. Due to the widespread use of technology within the young adult population, digital health tools such as digital storytelling (DST) have been promoted as an effective way to increase vaccination uptake.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a formative inquiry into (1) what components should be considered for inclusion in an HPV documentary tailored for sexual and gender minority populations and (2) what dissemination channels would be more effective and impact the uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine among sexual and gender minority populations. Additionally, this study aims to provide insight into perceived HPV risk and its implications on the HPV vaccine uptake within the LGBTQ+ population.\nMETHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted between January 2021 and September 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. Intake surveys were distributed to individuals identifying as members of the LGBTQ+ community to examine demographic characteristics, barriers to vaccine adherence, and current HPV vaccination status. Perceived HPV risk was assessed using 5 statements on a 1 to 7 Likert scale. Key informant interviews were conducted via Zoom with participants who completed the intake surveys and consented to be interviewed. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using the constant comparison method for emergent themes surrounding components of effective DST campaigns.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven individuals completed the intake survey and interview.

The shift to outpatient postoperative care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizes the need for effective management of postoperative outcomes. The high rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Korea necessitate focused transitional care during patient discharge periods. However, limited research exists on the postoperative experiences of discharged patients, underscoring the necessity of establishing evidence-based services to optimize transitional care.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to analyze the emotional experiences of patients who underwent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular surgeries using data from Naver, a major South Korean web portal.\nMETHODS: Posts were collected using specific keywords and processed with the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KoBERT) model based on Transformer, which classified sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. Model performance was validated according to precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Sentiment analysis was conducted within the Transitional Care Model (TCM) framework, divided into 5 domains: health status, care resources, care demand, interaction, and mental state.\nRESULTS: The KoBERT model demonstrated high classification performance, achieving a precision of 96%, recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 94%. Sentiment analysis revealed that compared with cardiovascular surgery patients, cerebrovascular surgery patients experienced higher negative emotions regarding health status, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients expressed more negative sentiments in care demands.\nCONCLUSIONS: Different patient groups experience distinct emotional and practical challenges postdischarge. Particularly, keywords within the TCM framework highlight that cerebrovascular surgery patients require robust rehabilitation and caregiver support, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients need better cost management.

Combining an unsupervised machine learning technique and density functional theory calculations, we validated the system size for quantum calculations and investigated the impact of SCs on the excited states. Then, following the sequential QM/MM approach, we determined the absorption spectra of each polymer.

Clinician-patient communication is central to promoting the uptake of and adherence to digital health behavior change interventions.

This study also aims to explore oncologists' informational and technological support requirements to facilitate these conversations.\nMETHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 18 oncologists who provide cancer care in a large National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. The transcripts and interview notes were analyzed through an iterative thematic analysis to generate relevant themes and categories.\nRESULTS: We identified 2 major themes with 7 subthemes. The first theme focused on oncologists' desired roles in promoting health behavior change, while the second theme addressed the support needs to facilitate conversations about risk and health promotion. Oncologists expressed a desire for 2 action-oriented communication mechanisms for promoting digital health behavior change with their patients: referring patients to interventions and reinforcing intervention goals longitudinally. To facilitate risk behavior and health behavior change conversations, their support needs included a preference for low-burden, electronic health record-integrated tools providing timely updates on patient enrollment and progress. The participating oncologists requested a tailored conversation aid for patient communication and parallel systems combining electronic health record messaging with print materials. They also emphasized the need for automated recommender systems to identify and refer eligible patients and reminder systems to prompt timely discussions with patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oncologists are motivated and well-positioned to support patients' health behavior change but have unmet informational and technological requirements. On the basis of oncologists' perspectives, our findings provide actionable, user-centered, low-burden strategies for facilitating oncologist-patient conversations about digital health behavior change interventions.

Managing the disease remains a significant challenge, especially with the risks and severe side effects of current treatments, underscoring the need for safer and more effective therapies. Natural sources, particularly flavonoids, have shown considerable promise in reducing blood glucose levels. Flavonoids, a diverse group of bioactive compounds found in various medicinal plants, have demonstrated potent antidiabetic properties. Notable flavonoids, such as apigenin, arbutin, catechins, and cyanidin, have been shown to lower blood glucose and enhance insulin secretion. Their clinical effectiveness is attributed to their ability to regulate metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal several mechanisms of action at the molecular, cellular, and subcellular levels, including the activation of glycolytic pathways and the inhibition of glucose synthesis and storage. This review provides an overview of the clinical potential of flavonoids in diabetes management, detailing their molecular mechanisms of action. Although flavonoids show promising results in reducing fasting blood glucose levels, most human studies have been short-term supplementation trials and lack long-term safety data and evidence for sustained glucose regulation.

However, if this target is to be achieved, efforts will need to be increased, as full coverage of essential services remains an issue. Access to quality, acceptable and affordable healthcare remains an illusion for many Ugandans. Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable tool in achieving UHC as it can increase access to health facilities in hard-to-reach areas. AI tools have also been reported to perform faster than humans at certain key health tasks like diagnosis. However, for AI to be effective in delivering its benefits, context-specific regulatory approaches are key, as needs and opportunities differ. In this paper, I argue that the regulation of AI can help make it an effective tool for achieving UHC in Uganda if the right regulatory approach and framework are adopted, as regulation shapes outcomes. This will tackle the risk of poor regulation hindering AI development and AI reinforcing inequalities.\nMETHODS: The paper employs a doctrinal methodology to analyse the two prominent regulatory approaches to AI in the EU and UK, which have adopted a risk-based and principles-based approach, respectively. It investigates whether these approaches are suitable for regulating AI in Uganda's healthcare and achieving UHC. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are examined. The paper advocates for considering a human rights-based approach that can be integrated with the principles-based approach.\nRESULTS: Regulation is a double-edged tool that can positively or negatively shape health outcomes. Good regulation has the potential to emancipate ordinary people's lives. Therefore, Uganda should leverage the positive aspects of principles-based and human rights-based approaches to regulation to ensure that AI's potential to achieve UHC is effective.\nCONCLUSION: The hybrid approach to AI regulation is best suited to serve Uganda's healthcare needs.

Participants were divided into two groups: 30 mothers received AI-based counseling, and 30 mothers were provided a booklet. Data collection tools included a personal information form, Breastfeeding Charting System and Assessment Tool (LATCH), Postnatal Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Data were collected from mothers who delivered at a state hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department and were followed for ten days postpartum (postpartum days 1, 3, 7, and 10).\nRESULTS: No significant differences were found in the demographic characteristics of the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant improvements were observed in breastfeeding self-efficacy over time for both groups (AI group: f = 36.356, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 43.349, p = 0.000). At day 10, the AI group scored significantly higher than the booklet group (Z=-2.216, p = 0.027). For breastfeeding success, as measured by the LATCH tool, significant differences were also noted over time for both groups (AI group: f = 68.466, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 68.088, p = 0.000). At day seven, the AI group outperformed the booklet group (Z=-2.995, p = 0.003). Anxiety levels showed no significant differences between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-based breastfeeding counseling positively impacts breastfeeding self-efficacy and success. The findings highlight the potential of AI applications in healthcare. AI-based chatbots can serve as effective tools for breastfeeding education, offering accessible, personalized, and continuous support. The significant improvements in breastfeeding outcomes indicate that innovative AI-assisted interventions can effectively support mothers during the critical early postpartum period.

However, up to 50% of patients do not achieve sufficient symptom relief. Identifying patient characteristics predictive of higher post-treatment symptom severity is crucial for devising personalized interventions to avoid treatment failures and reduce healthcare costs.\nMETHODS: Using the Swedish multimodal database MULTI-PSYCH, we evaluated novel and established predictors associated with treatment outcome and assessed the added benefit of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and nationwide register data in a sample of 2668 patients treated with ICBT for major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Two linear regression models were compared: a baseline model employing six well-established predictors and a full model incorporating six clinic-based, 32 register-based predictors, and PRS for seven psychiatric disorders and traits. Predictor importance was assessed through bivariate associations, and models were compared by the variance explained in post-treatment symptom scores.\nRESULTS: Our analysis identified several novel predictors of higher post-treatment severity, including comorbid ASD and ADHD, receipt of financial benefits, and prior use of psychotropic medications. The baseline model explained 27%, while the full model accounted for 34% of the variance.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a model incorporating a broad array of multimodal data offered a modest improvement in explanatory power compared to one using a limited set of easily accessible measures.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, offers innovative ways for enhancing communication skills training by simulating realistic conversational scenarios and providing personalised, adaptive feedback. This manuscript is presented as study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled trial that aims at evaluating the efficacy of an AI-supported higher education training protocol incorporating generative AI exercises to enhance communication competencies among psychology students.\nMETHODS: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, psychology students enrolled in communication skill seminars at a medium sized university in a medium sized German city will participate.

Additional non-randomised comparison classes will comprise students with TAU only, but not be part of main analyses. The primary outcome is the change in communication skills from baseline, assessed through questions reflecting the communication techniques emphasised in the training. Secondary outcomes include communication skills, self-efficacy and self-concept, motivation, attitudes toward AI, user experience with the AI tool, student evaluations of course quality, and feasibility aspects such as uptake and usability.

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a paradigm shift in the practice of health sciences particularly in medicine. In the dental field, AI has been scarcely used in the various disciplines with no application in dental traumatology. This study proposes a deep-learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based model for detection and classification of dental fractures.\nMETHODS: Plain periapical radiographs of injured teeth were retrieved from patients' records and annotated by two dentists trained in dental traumatology. The teeth were categorised into four groups: uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures and root fractures. Data augmentation was done to enhance the power of the current dataset. Images were divided into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Python programming language was used to implement the CNN-based classification model. Cross validation was applied.\nRESULTS: A total of 72 plain periapical radiographs of 108 fractured teeth were collected. The model achieved high accuracy in differentiating uncomplicated crown fractures from complicated ones (96.0%), from crown-root fractures (99.1%) and from root fractures (98.7%). Furthermore, the complicated injuries were distinguished from crown-root fractures and from root fractures with accuracy levels at 96.3% and 97.2% respectively.

The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has automated treatment planning, significantly improving efficiency. However, existing automatic treatment planning agents often rely on supervised or unsupervised AI models that require large datasets of high-quality patient data for training. Additionally, these networks are generally not universally applicable across patient cases from different institutions and can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which mimics the trial-and-error process used by human planners, offers a promising new approach to address these challenges.  PURPOSE: This work aims to develop a stochastic policy-based DRL agent for automatic treatment planning that facilitates effective training with limited datasets, universal applicability across diverse patient datasets, and robust performance under adversarial attacks.\nMETHODS: We employ an actor-critic with experience replay (ACER) architecture to develop the automatic treatment planning agent. This agent operates the treatment planning system (TPS) for inverse treatment planning by automatically tuning treatment planning parameters (TPPs). We use prostate cancer IMRT patient cases as our testbed, which includes one target and two organs at risk (OARs), along with 18 discrete TPP tuning actions. The network takes dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as input and outputs a policy for effective TPP tuning, accompanied by an evaluation function for that policy. Training utilizes DVHs from treatment plans generated by an in-house TPS under randomized TPPs for a single patient case, with validation conducted on two other independent cases. Both online asynchronous learning and offline, sample-efficient experience replay methods are employed to update the network parameters. After training, six groups, comprising more than 300 initial treatment plans drawn from three datasets, were used for testing. These groups have beam and anatomical configurations distinct from those of the training case. The ProKnow scoring system for prostate cancer IMRT, with a maximum score of 9, is used to evaluate plan quality. The robustness of the network is further assessed through adversarial attacks using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM).\nRESULTS: Despite being trained on treatment plans from a single patient case, the network converges efficiently when validated on two independent cases. For testing performance, the mean ± $\\pm$  standard deviation of the plan scores across all test cases before ACER-based treatment planning is  6.17 ± 1.90 $6.17 \\pm 1.90$  . After implementing ACER-based treatment planning,  92.29 % $92.29\\%$  of the cases achieve a perfect score of 9, with only  6.65 % $6.65\\%$  scoring between 8 and 9, and no cases being below 7. The corresponding mean ± $\\pm$  standard deviation is  8.92 ± 0.29 $8.92 \\pm 0.29$  . This performance highlights the ACER agent's high generality across patient data from various sources. Further analysis indicates that the ACER agent effectively prioritizes leading reasonable TPP tuning actions over obviously unsuitable ones by several orders of magnitude, showing its efficacy. Additionally, results from FGSM attacks demonstrate that the ACER-based agent remains comparatively robust against various levels of perturbation.\nCONCLUSIONS: We successfully trained a DRL agent using the ACER technique for high-quality treatment planning in prostate cancer IMRT.

To overcome this challenge, in this work, we explore various ways of introducing the latent information present in evolutionarily related sequences (homologous sequences) into the training process. To do so, we establish several strategies based on semi-supervised learning (unsupervised pre-processing and wrapper methods) and perform a comprehensive comparison using 19 datasets containing protein-fitness pairs. Our findings reveal that using the information present in the homologous sequences can improve the performance of the models, especially when the number of available labelled sequences is considerably low.

We designed a multi-modal deep-learning framework that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to analyze MRI and additional neural networks to evaluate demographic data. Our initial model focused on predicting brain age, serving as a foundational model from which we developed separate models for cognition function and amyloid plaque prediction through transfer learning.\nRESULTS: The brain age prediction model achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) for cognitive normal population in the ADNI (test) datasets of 3.302 years.

For clinical applications, accurate and rapid temperature feedback is essential to ensure both the safety and effectiveness of these treatments.\nPURPOSE: This work aims to improve temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstructions using an enhanced deep-learning method, thereby supporting the real-time monitoring required for effective FUS treatments.\nMETHODS: Five classical neural network architectures-cascade net, complex-valued U-Net, shift window transformer for MRI, real-valued U-Net, and U-Net with residual blocks-along with training-optimized methods were applied to reconstruct temperature maps from 2-fold and 4-fold undersampled k-space data. The training enhancements included pre-training/training-phase data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and a novel amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. Phantom and ex vivo tissue heating experiments were conducted using a FUS transducer. Ground truth was the complex MR images with accurate temperature changes, and datasets were manually undersampled to simulate such acceleration here. Separate testing datasets were used to evaluate real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed deep learning-based rapid reconstruction approach was validated on a clinical dataset obtained from patients with uterine fibroids, demonstrating its clinical applicability.\nRESULTS: Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were achieved for 2× and 4× k-space under samplings, respectively. The deep learning-based reconstruction using ResUNet incorporating the four optimizations, showed superior performance. For 2-fold acceleration, the RMSE of temperature map patches were 0.89°C and 1.15°C for the phantom and ex vivo testing datasets, respectively. The DICE coefficient for the 43°C isotherm-enclosed regions was 0.81, and the Bland-Altman analysis indicated a bias of -0.25°C with limits of agreement of ±2.16°C. In the 4-fold under-sampling case, these evaluation metrics showed approximately a 10% reduction in accuracy.

Salivary biomarkers, including beta-defensin-2 (BD-2) and statherin (STATH), offer potential as non-invasive tools for detecting and assessing the risk of ECC. This study aims to compare the levels of salivary statherin and beta-defensin-2, alongside oral health behaviors and demographic factors, in children both with and without early childhood caries.\nMETHODS: This case-control study involved 75 children diagnosed with ECC and 75 age- and gender-matched caries-free controls. Unstimulated saliva samples were obtained and analyzed via ELISA to quantify the levels of beta-defensin-2 and statherin. Demographic and behavioral data were gathered through structured interviews with parents. Statistical analyses included t-tests, logistic regression, and machine learning models to predict the risk of ECC.\nRESULTS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 levels were significantly higher in children with ECC (9.25 ± 2.89 ng/mL) compared to caries-free controls (6.41 ± 2.45 ng/mL, p = 0.003), indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Statherin levels, although lower in the ECC group, did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.08). Behavioral factors such as regular dental visits and parental education levels were strongly associated with ECC prevalence. Machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting ECC, with the Gradient Boosting and CatBoost achieving the highest performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 is a promising ECC risk assessment biomarker, while statherin is less effective as an independent predictor.

Achieving near normal blood glucose levels with insulin, a primary goal of diabetes management, carries a significant risk of hypoglycaemia. There is compelling evidence that an abnormal gut microbiota or dysbiosis can increase intestinal permeability (IP) and contribute to dysglycaemia seen in T1D. Given that prebiotic fibre can mitigate dysbiosis, reduce IP and improve glycaemic control, we hypothesise that microbial changes induced by prebiotics contribute to gut and endocrine adaptations that reduce glucose fluctuations, including less hypoglycaemia. In a pilot study, we showed that in children who had T1D for at least 1 year, a 3-month course of prebiotic fibre significantly reduced the frequency of hypoglycaemia. The prebiotic group had an increase in Bifidobacterium with a moderate improvement in IP. Importantly, the prebiotic group maintained their serum C peptide level (marker of residual beta cell function) while the placebo group saw a drop. Given that preserving endogenous beta cell function in patients with T1D, particularly in the first year of diagnosis, reduces hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability, we propose to examine the effect of prebiotic supplementation in patients with T1D.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Individuals (n=144) with T1D will be randomised 1:1 for 6 months to prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin) or placebo (isocaloric maltodextrin). Participants will have three in-person study visits at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The primary outcome, frequency of hypoglycaemia, will be determined from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) reports and patient blood glucose logs. Secondary outcomes will include glycaemic variability, time-in-range, glycated haemoglobin, stimulated C peptide, IP, serum inflammatory markers, quality of life and fear of hypoglycaemia ratings, as well as gut microbiome and metabolomics analysis. At 9 months, participant CGM data will be used to assess frequency of hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability at 3 months postintervention.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical approval from the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (REB21-0852).

Two molecular clusters were identified using \"ConsensusClusterPlus\". With the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, a prognostic signature was built based on cuproptosis. The prognosis, clinical parameters, biological function, immune cell infiltration, therapy sensitivities, and transcription factor regulation of the clusters and risk subsets were further compared. Kaplan Meier curves, time-ROC curves, and nomogram were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the signature. Lastly, qRT-PCR was used to detect prognostic genes in cell lines and clinical samples.\nRESULTS: CRGs exhibited extensive genetic variations and heterogeneous expression profiles in ALL. Single-cell analysis demonstrated that CRGs were strongly correlated with the biological characteristics of cancer cells. Two clusters and risk subgroups with distinct clinicopathological features, prognoses, biological functions, and drug sensitivities were identified. The cuproptosis signature was crucial in characterizing tumor immune landscape and cancer cell self-renewal ability.

As in all radiotherapy, accurate in vivo dosimetry is crucial for quality assurance of safe and efficient treatment delivery. However, this remains a challenge for UHDR as existing dosimetry systems lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to verify dose and dose rate in complex anatomical regions, especially for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy.\nPURPOSE: This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel 3D surface dosimetry method for UHDR PBS proton therapy using high-speed imaging of a scintillator array, coupled with stereovision to provide real-time, high-resolution surface dose monitoring during treatment. The spatial, temporal, and dosimetric components of the proposed system are validated via imaging of a custom QA phantom and are compared against a gafchromic film reading of the same field delivered onto a flat surface.\nMETHODS: A freely deformable multielement scintillator array was designed with a single element pitch of 7.5 mm and interelement gap of 0.5 mm. Scintillation linearity with dose was evaluated along with the variation in scintillator response with increasing imaging and irradiation angles. Water-equivalent thickness (WET) testing was conducted to evaluate beam attenuation at two energy levels. Scintillation emission in response to dose delivery was imaged at 1000 Hz using a high frame rate camera (BeamSite Ultra, DoseOptics LLC) and the array position was monitored via a 2-camera stereovision system. Imaging system setup was validated using a custom 3D QA phantom to assess spatial accuracy and guide systematic setup correction. Stereovision properties of each array element were used to guide angular emission correction, and geometric transformation to beams-eye-view (BEV). Kernel-based residual spot fitting was applied to derive cumulative dose maps which were then compared to the flat film dose profile of a 5 × 5 cm UHDR PBS delivery using 3%/2 mm gamma analysis. PBS and maximum dose rate maps were also calculated.\nRESULTS: System setup achieved an average localization error of 0.62 mm, surpassing the typical 1+ mm threshold used in clinical practice. Intensity correction based on angular information was applied and yielded a cumulative spot dose uncertainty of ∼1% (5.428 mGy). The processed dose map was compared to film via gamma analysis with 3%/2 mm criteria and showed a 99.9% passing rate, indicating high agreement between the planned and measured dose profiles. The WET of the scintillator array was measured to be 1.1 mm, minimizing its impact on dose distribution.\nCONCLUSION: The novel scintillator array system provides accurate, real-time surface dose monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolution, making it a promising tool for in vivo dosimetry in UHDR proton therapy.

Despite ongoing efforts, the management of T2DM remains challenging due to its complex pathogenesis and the limited effectiveness of current treatments. Jinqi Jiangtang Tablets (JQJTT), a well-established Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, have shown promising clinical benefits in regulating blood glucose levels and improving metabolic health in T2DM patients. However, the specific pharmacological mechanisms behind its efficacy are still not fully understood, prompting the need for deeper exploration into its therapeutic actions.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the pharmacologically active ingredients and mechanisms of JQJTT in T2DM using multi-omics methods combined with experimental verification.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified the chemical profile of JQJTT, and targets were screened via SwissTargetPrediction database. T2DM-related targets were acquired from GeneCards and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Therapeutic targets were ascertained by intersecting JQJTT and T2DM targets, followed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment was performed, and the compound-target-pathway network was built using Cytoscape. Mendelian randomization, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), and CIBERSORT analyses were executed to explore immune cell involvement. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified affected cell types, while molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation assessed compound-target affinities. Metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing analyzed JQJTT's effects on metabolites and gut microbiota.\nRESULTS: LC-MS identified 161 compounds in JQJTT. Through network pharmacology, 6 core targets (AKT1, MMP9, HSP90AA1, CASP3, IL-6, PTGS2) were screened, and PI3K/AKT, NFκB, and lipid metabolism were pinpointed as key regulatory pathways. Mendelian randomization linked 39 immune cell types to T2DM, while ssGSEA and CIBERSORT suggested JQJTT potentially modulated the proportion of immune cells. scRNA-seq indicated JQJTT may affect macrophage polarization. Tangeritin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol were determined as the main active compounds with glucose-lowering effects confirmed in vitro. In vivo experiments validated the molecular mechanisms of JQJTT against T2DM. Metabolomics unearthed 56 differentially abundant metabolites, primarily in linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and pyruvaldehyde metabolisms.

Patients aged < 60 years, male sex, absence of right hemicolectomy, postoperative peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≥ 25, and perineural invasion demonstrated significantly lower 1-year and 2-year survival rates compared to their counterparts, with distinct separation observed in the Kaplan-Meier curves. These factors likely reflect biological differences in disease progression, inadequate surgical debulking, and aggressive tumor behavior.\nCONCLUSIONS: a-MiNEN with PMP progresses rapidly.

The pathophysiology of PD is complex and multifactorial involving genetic factors, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein clearance, and neuroinflammation but recent evidence emphasizes the role of impaired brain insulin signaling. Insulin is a metabolic hormone with extensive effects on metabolic substrates but recent studies have demonstrated that it is also involved in central signaling pathways and induces different brain areas related to food craving, motor activities, cognitive abilities, and emotional feelings. Hence it has been suggested that induction of brain insulin sensitivity may be a promising treatment for PD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics are a new-generation class of antidiabetics that normalize glucose homeostasis via several pathways. Recent studies suggest extra-glycemic benefits for GLP-1 mimetics against PD. GLP-1 mimetics can prevent or slow PD progression.

Despite extensive research, the regulatory factors of NF-kB signaling required to preserve homeostasis and control inflammatory disorders are not fully understood. Moreover, the role of MARCH2 in chronic inflammation models and the regulation of MARCH2 activation remain to be elucidated.\nMETHODS: We monitored disease severity and mortality in MARCH2-/- or MARCH2+/+ mice induced experimental colitis. Susceptibility to DSS-induced experimental colitis was determined by various methods, including Swiss roll assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran treatment, respectively. RNA-sequencing was conducted to recognize the inflammatory response-related genes in the distal colon of colitis-induced mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the cytokines and chemokines with in vitro and in vivo samples. Affinity purification and LC-MS/MS analysis were used to identify the MARCH2 interacting proteins and posttranslational modifications. The underlying mechanism was elucidated using immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination assay, and confocal microscopy.\nRESULT: Here, we report that MARCH2-/- mice were more susceptible to experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to the massive production of cytokines. Stimulation by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF induces dimerization of MARCH2 at a later stage and dimerized MARCH2 undergoes K63-linked autoubiquitination at lysine 127 and 238, which promotes NEMO recognition, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We also show an interaction between MARCH2 and MARCH8 in resting cells that inhibits MARCH2 activation. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of MARCH2 and suggest a crucial role of MARCH2 in the modulation of inflammation and cellular homeostasis.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MARCH2 plays a critical role in regulating NEMO/IKKγ under the inflammatory and resting conditions, thereby suppressing excessive or unexpected inflammatory responses.

Various guidelines have formulated key principles, such as fairness, robustness, and explainability, as essential components to achieve trustworthy AI. However, conceptualizations of trustworthy AI often emphasize technical requirements and computational solutions, frequently overlooking broader aspects of fairness and potential biases. These include not only algorithmic bias but also human, institutional, social, and societal factors, which are critical to foster AI systems that are both ethically sound and socially responsible. This viewpoint article presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyzing trust in AI and trustworthy AI within the medical context, focusing on (1) social sciences and humanities conceptualizations and legal perspectives on trust and (2) their implications for trustworthy AI in health care. It focuses on real-world challenges in medicine that are often underrepresented in theoretical discussions to propose a more practice-oriented understanding. Insights were gathered from an interdisciplinary workshop with experts from various disciplines involved in the development and application of medical AI, particularly in oncological imaging and genomics, complemented by theoretical approaches related to trust in AI. Results emphasize that, beyond common issues of bias and fairness, knowledge and human involvement are essential for trustworthy AI. Stakeholder engagement throughout the AI life cycle emerged as crucial, supporting a human- and multicentered framework for trustworthy AI implementation. Findings emphasize that trust in medical AI depends on providing meaningful, user-oriented information and balancing knowledge with acceptable uncertainty. Experts highlighted the importance of confidence in the tool's functionality, specifically that it performs as expected. Trustworthiness was shown to be not a feature but rather a relational process, involving humans, their expertise, and the broader social or institutional contexts in which AI tools operate. Trust is dynamic, shaped by interactions among individuals, technologies, and institutions, and ultimately centers on people rather than tools alone. Tools are evaluated based on reliability and credibility, yet trust fundamentally relies on human connections. The article underscores the development of AI tools that are not only technically sound but also ethically robust and broadly accepted by end users, contributing to more effective and equitable AI-mediated health care. Findings highlight that building AI trustworthiness in health care requires a human-centered, multistakeholder approach with diverse and inclusive engagement.

Currently, several uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods have been proposed and successfully applied in the fields of molecules and proteins, effectively improving model prediction quality and interpretability. Protein-RNA binding represents a fundamental aspect of protein research. Accurate prediction of binding sites and ensuring the reliability of such predictions are crucial for various scientific endeavors. However, many of the existing computational methods have a single feature extraction and lack of UQ. To address these, we propose MGCA (multiscale graph convolutional networks, convolutional neural networks and attention) to better capture local and global information and achieve competitive results in predicting protein-RNA binding sites. Moreover, we launch a UQ study based on MGCA and five prevalent models to verify the robustness of the results. Specifically, we introduce the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess the uncertainty of the models.

Results show that the split-bins screening method reduces false positives (FP), and TS significantly decreases the model ECE.

Statistical analysis was performed from May 2023 to February 2025.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: First, 2 different methods-the validated algorithm and machine learning techniques as the robustness check-were used to identify respondents with probable dementia. Then the status of dementia was used to estimate the association of cohort with dementia status by age-period-cohort methodology.\nRESULTS: Of the 99 420 individuals (mean [SD] age, 79.1 [6.2] years; 59.2% women) in the HRS dataset, 21 069 (21.2%) were included in this study; of the 83 580 individuals (mean [SD] age, 78.6 [5.9] years; 54.7% women) in the SHARE dataset, 32 490 (38.9%) were included in this study; and of the 31 384 individuals (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [5.6] years; 55.8% women) in the ELSA dataset, 8878 (28.3%) were included in this study. Focusing on people aged 71 years or older and controlling for age and period effects, birth cohorts born more recently were less likely to develop dementia in all 3 regions, albeit at different rates (point estimate for 1944-1948 vs 1919-1923 cohorts: US, -0.55 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.34] vs -0.18 [95% CI, -0.25 to -0.10]; Europe, -1.49 [95% CI, -1.72 to -1.27] vs -0.24 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.13]; and England, -0.48 [95% CI, -0.89 to -0.08] vs -0.23 [95% CI, -0.38 to -0.07]). This decreasing trend was more pronounced among women than men (point estimate in 1944-1948 for women vs men: US, -0.55 [95% CI, -0.86 to -0.30] vs -0.48 [95% CI, -0.84 to -0.13]; Europe, -1.50 [95% CI, -1.80 to -1.21] vs -1.34 [95% CI, -1.70 to -0.99]; and England, -0.76 [95% CI, -1.30 to -0.23] vs -0.07 [95% CI, -0.69 to 0.54]); the point estimates for men in England were not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study examining generational differences in age-specific dementia prevalence across the US, Europe, and England, we found that individuals from more recent birth cohorts had lower proportions of people with dementia.

Patients with culture-confirmed TB were identified through electronic health records. Demographic data, cancer history, systemic cancer therapy, and comorbidities were analyzed to assess any association between active TB and previous solid tumors.\nRESULTS: Among 87 patients diagnosed with active TB (incidence rate: 5.1 per 100,000 inhabitants per year), 64.4% were male, with a median age of 48 years (range: 0-85). Only four patients (4.6%) had a history of solid tumor, none of whom had received systemic cancer therapy or radiotherapy prior to active TB diagnosis. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between TB patients with a history of cancer and the general population, and there were no significant associations between gender, country of origin, or systemic cancer therapy.\nCONCLUSION: In this low-incidence TB region, previous medical history of solid tumor among active TB patients is marginal. Solid tumor history does not behave as a strong risk factor for active TB development. In this region, routine latent TB screening in solid cancer patients is not supported by scientific evidence.

However, clinicians, especially junior physicians, often face challenges due to the complexity of describing patient phenotypes accurately. Traditional manual search methods using HPO databases are time-consuming and prone to errors.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate whether the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can improve the accuracy of junior physicians in identifying HPO terms from patient images related to rare diseases.\nMETHODS: In total, 20 junior physicians from 10 specialties participated. Each physician evaluated 27 patient images sourced from publicly available literature, with phenotypes relevant to rare diseases listed in the Chinese Rare Disease Catalogue. The study was divided into 2 groups: the manual search group relied on the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology website, while the MLLM-assisted group used an electronic questionnaire that included HPO terms preidentified by ChatGPT-4o as prompts, followed by a search using the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology. The primary outcome was the accuracy of HPO identification, defined as the proportion of correctly identified HPO terms compared to a standard set determined by an expert panel. Additionally, the accuracy of outputs from ChatGPT-4o and 2 open-source MLLMs (Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b) was evaluated using the same criteria, with hallucinations for each model documented separately. Furthermore, participating physicians completed an additional electronic questionnaire regarding their rare disease background to identify factors affecting their ability to accurately describe patient images using standardized HPO terms.\nRESULTS: A total of 270 descriptions were evaluated per group. The MLLM-assisted group achieved a significantly higher accuracy rate of 67.4% (182/270) compared to 20.4% (55/270) in the manual group (relative risk 3.31, 95% CI 2.58-4.25; P<.001). The MLLM-assisted group demonstrated consistent performance across departments, whereas the manual group exhibited greater variability. Among standalone MLLMs, ChatGPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 48% (13/27), while the open-source models Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b achieved 15% (4/27) and 18% (5/27), respectively. However, MLLMs exhibited a high hallucination rate, frequently generating HPO terms with incorrect IDs or entirely fabricated content.

Primary care physicians provide a significant portion of care, and they often struggle with selecting appropriate medications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a model that accurately predicts what drug an endocrinologist would prescribe based on the current measurements. The goal was to create a system that would assist nonspecialists in choosing medications, thereby potentially improving diabetes treatment outcomes. Based on the performance of previous studies, we set a performance target of achieving a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) above 0.95.\nMETHODS: A transformer-based encoder-decoder model predicts whether 44 types of diabetes drugs will be prescribed. The model uses sequences of age, sex, history for 12 laboratory tests, and prescribed drug history as inputs. We assessed the model using the electronic health records from 7034 patients with diabetes seeing endocrinologists between 2012 and 2022 at the University of Tokyo Hospital. We assessed model performance trained on data subsets spanning different time periods (2, 5, and 10 years) using micro- and macro-averaged ROC-AUC on a hold-out test set comprising data solely from 2022. The model's performance was compared against LightGBM.\nRESULTS: The model trained on data from the past 5 years (2017-2021) yielded the best predictive performance, achieving a microaverage (95% CI) ROC-AUC of 0.993 (0.992-0.994) and a macroaverage (95% CI) ROC-AUC of 0.988 (0.980-0.993). The model achieved an ROC-AUC above 0.95 for 43 out of 44 drugs. These results surpassed the predefined performance target and outperformed both previous studies and the LightGBM model's microaverage ROC-AUC of 0.988 (0.985-0.990) in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, training the model with short-term data from the past 5 years yielded high accuracy compared to using data from the past 10 years, suggesting that learning from more recent prescribing patterns might be advantageous.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting the next prescribed drugs. This model, trained from the past prescriptions of endocrinologists, has the potential to provide information that can assist nonspecialists in making diabetes-treatment decisions. Future studies will focus on incorporating important factors such as prescription contraindications and constraints to enhance safety, as well as leveraging large-scale clinical data across multiple hospitals to improve the generalizability of the model.", "authors": ["Kurasawa Hisashi", "Waki Kayo", "Seki Tomohisa", "Nakahara Eri", "Fujino Akinori", "Shiomi Nagisa", "Nakashima Hiroshi", "Ohe Kazuhiko"], "published_date": "2025-06-02", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "利用Transformer模型強化糖尿病藥物選擇：機器學習模型開發", "summary_zh": "糖尿病影響全球數百萬人，基層醫療醫師在照護上扮演重要角色，但常面臨藥物選擇的困境。本研究開發了一種基於Transformer的機器學習模型，能準確預測內分泌科醫師會開立的糖尿病藥物。該模型使用患者的年齡、性別、實驗室檢驗數據和用藥歷史等資訊進行訓練，並在東京大學醫院的7034名糖尿病患者的電子病歷上進行了驗證。結果顯示，使用過去五年的數據訓練的模型表現最佳，預測準確度超越了先前的研究和LightGBM模型。此模型有潛力協助非專科醫師做出更佳的糖尿病治療決策，未來將納入更多因素，如用藥禁忌和限制，並利用更大規模的臨床數據來提升模型的通用性。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果你的家庭醫生在幫你選擇糖尿病藥物時，有個AI助手可以參考專科醫生的經驗，就像有個虛擬的內分泌科專家在旁邊提供建議，這樣就能更精準地選擇適合你的藥物，減少試錯的時間。", "對於偏遠地區的居民來說，可能很難找到內分泌科醫生。這個AI模型就像一個遠程的專家顧問，可以幫助當地的醫生更好地管理糖尿病患者的用藥，讓他們也能得到和在大城市一樣的專業照護。", "這個模型可以幫助藥廠或醫療機構分析不同藥物組合的效果，找出最佳的用藥方案，從而設計出更有效的糖尿病管理計劃，提升整體治療效果，並可能降低醫療成本。"], "audio": "audios/40456113.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T01:20:43.441561"}

Preclinical learning benefited from AI-powered virtual patients and curriculum design tools that managed expanding medical knowledge and supported robust student practice. Within clinical learning, AI aided diagnostic and interpretive processes, prompting medical education curricula to demand relevant AI competency and literacy frameworks.

Additionally, the hyperparameters of these distributions are typically determined empirically, which may not accurately reflect the true distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a disease grading network utilizing a sample-aware asymmetric Gaussian label distribution, termed DGN-AGLD. This approach includes a variance predictor designed to learn and predict parameters that control the asymmetry of the Gaussian distribution, enabling distinct label distributions within the same category.

The growing number of individuals seeking help, coupled with the limited resources of clinics, highlights the critical need to identify factors that can predict treatment efficacy. Machine learning (ML) techniques hold great promise in this regard. This data-driven approach offers an unbiased means to uncover predictors of specific outcomes, advancing the understanding and management of this challenging condition.\nOBJECTIVE: Six supervised ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree and Random Forest) were applied to develop a binary classification model predicting short-term weight recovery/stabilization in AN inpatients and identify the most critical factors influencing this outcome.\nMETHODS: Change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from admission to discharge (ΔBMI) was used as the outcome, allowing to classify patients into \"improved\" (BMI stability or increase) and \"aggravation\" (BMI decrease). Predictors included clinically relevant psychological tests and physical parameters.

K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical.\nMETHODS: We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans.\nRESULTS: We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32, 22, and 12 dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24, 14, and 4 dB for fat-suppressed knee data.\nCONCLUSION: We showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions.

However, none of the available data have provided comprehensive estimates and projections at both regional and national levels in diabetes prevention and management. This study aimed to explore the temporal trends and geographical variations in the prevalence and non-fatal burden of diabetes by age and sex across China from 2005 to 2023, and to forecast diabetes prevalence through 2050.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based study based on the nationally representative surveys, and literature reviews. Using the DisMod-MR model and Chinese-specific disease disability weights, we estimated the non-fatal burdens of diabetes, including prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs), across sexes, age groups, and locations. The temporal trend change was measured as the average annual percent change. The effect of the Human Development Index on burdens was assessed by applying Spearman's rank correlation analysis. We further projected diabetes prevalence to 2050 under two scenarios, the natural trend and the effective intervention on body mass index (BMI).\nRESULTS: In 2023, an estimated 233 million individuals in China were living with diabetes. Compared to 2005, the age-standardized rate (ASR) of prevalence has increased by nearly 50%, from 7.53% (95% CI 7.00-8.10%) to 13.7% (95% CI 12.6-14.8%) in 2023. The ASR of YLDs was estimated at 19.1 per 1000 population (95% CI 18.6-19.5) in 2023, compared to 10.5 per 1000 population in 2005. The ASR of prevalence and YLDs was consistently higher in males than in females. The provinces with the highest diabetes prevalence and disease burden were Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Our forecast results suggest that if existing trends continue, the prevalence of obesity will reach 29.1% (95% CI 22.2-38.2%) nationally by 2050, with some provinces in the northern region observing a prevalence of over 40%.

However, the solid electrolyte interphase that is derived from the electrolyte easily hinders the diffusion and nucleation of Li+, which ultimately suppresses N2 activation and the subsequent protonation process. Herein, we successfully construct surface oxygen vacancies (Ov) on commercial BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles and further drive the phase transition from cubic/tetragonal to rhombohedral, which enhances the ferroelectricity of Ov-enriched BaTiO3 (BTOV) and produces orderly arranged dipoles. Systematic experimental and computational results validate that Ov-induced orderly arranged dipoles readily bind anions in the electrolyte and promote their reduction to form a LiF-rich SEI. The optimized anion-derived SEI enhances the Li+ transfer kinetics and effectively facilitates the uniform nucleation of Li+, which enables lower energy of Li+ desolvation and the reactant crossing the SEI. Thus, the as-prepared BTOV delivers a faradaic efficiency of 93.01% and an NH3 yield rate of 6.94 nmol s-1 cm-2 at -0.5 V which achieves more than a 45-fold performance improvement compared to the BTO counterpart.

Despite the rising global incidence of SLE, its aetiology remains unclear. We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR), multi-omics integration, machine learning (ML), and SHAP to identify key metabolites and genes associated with SLE, revealing the crucial role of the glutathione pathway. MR analysis was performed on 1400 serum metabolites, revealing significant enrichment in the glutathione metabolic pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data classified monocytes into Metabolism_high and Metabolism_low groups based on glutathione metabolism scores. Differentially expressed genes were analysed using GSEA, metabolic pathway activity assessment, transcription factor prediction, cellular communication analysis, and Pseudotime analysis. LASSO regression identified hub genes and machine learning models (CatBoost, XGBoost, NGBoost) were developed. The SHAP method was used to interpret these models. Expression of key genes was validated across multiple datasets. MR analysis confirmed that metabolites were enriched in the glutathione pathway, identifying nine hub genes. Machine learning models achieved AUCs of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.83 in the validation set. SHAP analysis highlighted LAP3 as the top contributing gene across all models. scRNA-seq data showed that LAP3 plays a significant role in the immune microenvironment of SLE.

Amblyopic subjects were classified as those without nystagmus (n = 42) and those with nystagmus with fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) or nystagmus that did not meet the criteria of FMN or infantile nystagmus syndrome (n = 53). A multihead attention-based transformer encoder model was trained and cross-validated on deblinked and denoised eye position data acquired during fixation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of amblyopia across types (anisometropia, strabismus, or mixed) and severity (treated, mild, moderate, or severe) and subjects with and without nystagmus was evaluated with area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and accuracy.\nRESULTS: Area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves for classification of subjects per type were 0.70 ± 0.16 for anisometropia (AUPRC: 0.72 ± 0.08), 0.78 ± 0.15 for strabismus (AUPRC: 0.81 ± 0.16), and 0.80 ± 0.13 for mixed (AUPRC: 0.82 ± 0.15). Area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves for classification of amblyopia subjects per severity were 0.77 ± 0.12 for treated/mild (AUPRC: 0.76 ± 0.18), and 0.78 ± 0.09 for moderate/severe (AUPRC: 0.79 ± 0.16).

Conventional symptom tracking methods rely on self-reports and clinical visits, which can be infrequent, subjective, and burdensome. Digital phenotyping using passively collected sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers offers a promising alternative for continuous, real-time symptom monitoring with minimal patient burden.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based digital phenotyping approach to monitor the severity of clinically-relevant MS symptoms. We used passive sensing data to predict short-term fluctuations in patient-reported symptoms, including depressive symptoms, global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality. Further, we examined the impact of incorporating behavioral context features and ecological momentary assessments on prediction performance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a 12- to 24-week longitudinal study involving 104 people with MS, collecting passive sensor and behavioral health data. Smartphone sensors recorded call activity, location, and screen use, while fitness trackers captured heart rate, sleep patterns, and step count. We extracted patient-level behavioral features and categorized them into 2 feature sets: one from the prediction period (called action) and one from the preceding period (called context). Using an ML pipeline based on support vector machines and AdaBoost, we evaluated the predictive performance of sensor-based models, both with and without ecological momentary assessment inputs.\nRESULTS: Between November 16, 2019, and January 24, 2021, overall, 104 people with MS (women: n=88, 84.6%; non-Hispanic White: n=97, 93.3%; mean age 44, SD 11.8 years) from a clinic-based cohort completed 12 weeks of data collection, including a subset of 44 participants (women: n=39, 89%; non-Hispanic White: n=42, 95%; mean age 45.7, SD 11.2 years) who completed 24 weeks of data collection. In total, we collected approximately 12,500 days of passive sensor and behavioral health data from the participants. Among the best-performing models with the least sensor data requirement, the ML algorithm predicted depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 80.6% (F1-score=0.76), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 77.3% (F1-score=0.78), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 73.8% (F1-score=0.74), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 72.0% (F1-score=0.70). Further, sensor data were largely sufficient for predicting symptom severity, while the prediction of depressive symptoms benefited from minimal active patient input in the form of responses to 2 brief questions on the day before the prediction point.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our digital phenotyping approach using passive sensors on smartphones and fitness trackers may help patients with real-world, continuous self-monitoring of common symptoms in their own environment and assist clinicians with better triage of patient needs for timely interventions in MS and potentially other chronic neurological disorders.", "authors": ["Xia Zongqi", "Chikersal Prerna", "Venkatesh Shruthi", "Walker Elizabeth", "Dey Anind K", "Goel Mayank"], "published_date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "利用被動感測行為與生態瞬時評估進行多發性硬化症嚴重程度的縱向數位表型分析：真實世界評估", "summary_zh": "這項研究利用智慧型手機和健身追蹤器的感測器數據，開發了一種數位表型方法，來監測多發性硬化症(MS)患者的症狀嚴重程度。研究追蹤了104位MS患者長達12到24週，收集他們的通話紀錄、定位、螢幕使用時間、心率、睡眠模式和步數等數據。透過機器學習演算法，研究成功預測了憂鬱症狀、整體MS症狀負擔、嚴重疲勞和不良睡眠品質等症狀的短期波動，準確率最高可達80.6%。研究結果表明，這種數位表型方法有助於MS患者在日常生活中持續自我監測症狀，並協助臨床醫生及時介入治療，改善患者的生活品質。", "applications": ["想像一下，未來多發性硬化症患者只要戴著智慧手錶或帶著手機，就能自動追蹤自己的疲勞程度、睡眠品質等等。如果數據顯示狀況不好，系統就會提醒他該休息或尋求醫療協助，就像一個隨時在身邊關心你的健康小幫手。", "這項技術也能幫助醫生更了解病人的狀況。醫生不用只靠病人自己回憶，而是能看到客觀的數據，例如病人的活動量、睡眠時間等等，就能更準確地判斷病情，給予更個人化的治療建議。", "藥廠或研究機構可以利用這些數據，更快速、更有效地評估新的治療方法對多發性硬化症患者的影響。例如，他們可以觀察使用新藥後，病人的活動量、睡眠品質是否有改善，從而判斷藥物的療效。"], "audio": "audios/40459924.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T18:24:02.191187"}

Machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, are promising in this regard. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data can lead to model drift, where the model's performance degrades over time, as the underlying data distribution changes due to evolving disease characteristics, demographic shifts, and variations in recording conditions. Addressing this challenge is crucial to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of these models in ongoing diagnostic applications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework that not only monitors model drift over time but also uses adaptation mechanisms to mitigate performance fluctuations in COVID-19 detection models trained on dynamic cough audio data.\nMETHODS: Two crowdsourced COVID-19 audio datasets, namely COVID-19 Sounds and Coswara, were used for development and evaluation purposes. Each dataset was divided into 2 distinct periods, namely the development period and postdevelopment period. A baseline convolutional neural network model was initially trained and evaluated using data (ie, coughs from COVID-19 Sounds and shallow coughs from Coswara dataset) from the development period. To detect changes in data distributions and the model's performance between these periods, the maximum mean discrepancy distance was used. Upon detecting significant drift, a retraining procedure was triggered to update the baseline model. The study explored 2 model adaptation approaches, unsupervised domain adaptation and active learning, both of which were comparatively assessed.\nRESULTS: The baseline model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 69.13% and a balanced accuracy of 63.38% on the development test set of the COVID-19 Sounds dataset, while for the Coswara dataset, the corresponding values were 66.8% and 61.64%. A decline in performance was observed when the model was evaluated on data from the postdevelopment period, indicating the presence of model drift. The application of the unsupervised domain adaptation approach led to performance improvement in terms of balanced accuracy by up to 22% and 24% for the COVID-19 Sounds and Coswara datasets, respectively. The active learning approach yielded even greater improvement, corresponding to a balanced accuracy increase of up to 30% and 60% for the 2 datasets, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of model drift in COVID-19 detection by enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data distributions.

Advances in spatial proteomics have shown that automatic recognition of protein subcellular localization from images could highly facilitate protein translocation analysis and biomarker discovery, but existing machine learning works have been mostly limited to processing 2D images. By contrast, 3D images have higher spatial resolution and allow researchers to observe cellular structures in their natural context, but currently there are only a few studies of 3D image processing for protein distribution analysis due to the lack of data and complexity of modeling.\nRESULTS: We develop a knowledge-enhanced protein subcellular localization model, KE3DLoc, which could recognize distribution patterns in 3D fluorescence microscope images using deep learning methods. The model designs an image feature extraction module that incorporates information from 3D and 2D projected cells, and implements an asymmetric loss and confidence weights to a data imbalance and weak cell annotation issues. Besides, considering that the biological knowledge in the Gene Ontology (GO) database can provide valuable support for protein location understanding, the KE3DLoc model incorporates a novel knowledge enhancement module that optimizes the protein representation by related knowledge graphs derived from the GO. Since the image module and the knowledge module calculate features from different levels, KE3DLoc designs protein ID aggregation to enhance the consistency of protein features across different cells.

Overcoming MDR to achieve effective cancer treatment remains a huge challenge. Here, we proposed a self-generative singlet oxygen (1O2)-initiated chemical modification of nuclear DNAs (SiCMoND) approach to kill multidrug-resistant tumor synergizing with chemotherapy. A tumor-targeted \"nano-bomb\" FA(CT-fT-Dox) was rationally fabricated by encapsulating the complex of Cu2+ with tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) (Cu-TCPP) as a 1O2 generator and a doxorubicin (Dox) prodrug tailed with a furan-containing positively charged peptide (fTAT-Dox) within the micelles of FA-PEG5000-PCL3000 and mPEG5000-PCL3000. When FA(CT-fT-Dox) nanoparticles accumulated at the tumor site, they could undergo disassembly in the tumor microenvironment (TME) specifically to release Cu-TCPP and fTAT-Dox simultaneously. Taking advantage of the features of Cu-TCPP that can convert tumor-abundant H2O2 into 1O2 and fTAT-Dox that can readily penetrate the cell membrane into the nucleus, chemical modification of nuclear DNAs was realized through the covalent cyclization reaction between furan and nucleobases of nuclear DNAs under the ignition of self-generative 1O2, which leads to significant DNA damage and enhanced therapeutic susceptibility.

While comorbid depression and health insurance disparities are individually known to potentiate this risk, technological devices for T1DM appear to be protective.\nOBJECTIVE: We examined whether technology use impacted the association between depression and poorer health outcomes in T1DM. Given established insurance-based disparities based on technology access, we also studied whether the protective effects of T1DM technology differed among publicly and privately insured youth.\nMETHODS: Data were prospectively collected from pediatric patients with T1DM across 3 California medical centers. We used linear and negative binomial regression analyses to examine whether technology use was related to diabetes outcomes and whether this differed based on depression status (technology-by-depression interaction) and health insurance type (technology-by-insurance interaction).\nRESULTS: Across 1573 patients aged 12 to 25 years (mean age 15.9, SD 2.9 years; n=1050, 66.4%, non-Hispanic White; n=745, 47.0% female), those with a depression diagnosis had higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; mean 9.1%, SD 2.1% vs 10.1%, SD 2.2%) and more frequent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events per year (mean 0.10, SD 0.36 vs 0.24, SD 0.66) than those without (P=.003).

However, current prediction models often rely on structured data and overlook the nuanced clinical reasoning embedded in free-text preoperative notes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened opportunities for harnessing unstructured clinical data, yet their application in perioperative prediction remains limited by concerns about factual accuracy. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution-enhancing LLM performance by grounding outputs in domain-specific knowledge sources, potentially improving both predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether integrating LLMs with RAG can improve the prediction of 30-day postoperative mortality and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification using unstructured preoperative clinical notes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 24,491 medical records from a tertiary medical center, including preoperative anesthesia assessments, discharge summaries, and surgical information. To extract clinical insights from free-text data, we used the LLaMA 3.1-8B language model with RAG, using MedEmbed for text embedding and Miller's Anesthesia as the primary retrieval source. We evaluated model performance under various configurations, including embedding models, chunk sizes, and few-shot prompting. Machine learning (ML) models, including random forest, support vector machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression, were trained on structured features as baselines.\nRESULTS: A total of 520 (2.1%) patients experienced in-hospital 30-day postoperative mortality. The ASA physical status distribution was as follows: class I: 535 (2.2%); class II: 15,272 (62.4%); class III: 8024 (32.8%); class IV: 606 (2.5%); and class V: 54 (0.22%). For 30-day postoperative mortality prediction, the LLaMA‑RAG model achieved an F1-score of 0.4663 (95% CI 0.4654-0.4672), versus 0.2369 (95% CI 0.2341-0.2397) without few‑shot prompting, 0.0879 (95% CI 0.0717-0.1041) without RAG, and 0.0436 (95% CI 0.0292-0.0580) without either few‑shot prompting or RAG.

Similar to the systemic lymphatic system, the glymphatic system plays a critical role in immune responses and has been implicated not only in Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory brain disorders but also in conditions such as hydrocephalus and glaucoma, which are associated with cerebrospinal fluid circulation impairments. Recent studies have suggested that dysfunction of the glymphatic system may promote the progression of brain tumors and reduce the efficacy of immune responses and pharmacological therapies targeting tumors. Radiotherapy is a major treatment option for brain tumors; however, while it can enhance immune responses against tumors, it may also suppress these responses at the same time. Additionally, cranial irradiation has been suggested to impair the function of the glymphatic system. This review provides an overview of the structure and functional evaluation methods of the glymphatic system, summarizes the effects of its dysfunction on brain tumor treatment, and explores recent findings on the impact of radiation therapy on glymphatic system functioning.

Natural products are considered potential candidates for the management of DM. Crocin, a natural carotenoid derived from saffron, has been reported to possess several pharmacological properties, including cardioprotective effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effects of crocin on the metabolic derangement of the diabetic myocardium. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated with 10 mg/kg of crocin daily for two weeks. Oral administration of crocin normalized blood glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels. Notably, crocin reduced the elevated protein levels of cardiac PPARα and PPARδ-major transcriptional regulators of cardiac metabolism-back to normal. Consequently, the expression of the fatty acid (FA) transporter CD36 was downregulated, the activity of the FA oxidation enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was decreased, and intramyocardial triglyceride accumulation returned to physiological levels. Furthermore, crocin improved glucose uptake and metabolism in the diabetic myocardium, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, enhanced activity of pyruvate kinase, and downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of crocin on Akt phosphorylation was also confirmed in isolated cardiac myocytes exposed to high glucose, further supporting its direct role in modulating glucose signaling pathways. Crocin treatment also reduced STZ-induced elevations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-as well as the phosphorylation of IκBα, bringing them close to basal levels. Overall, these findings suggest that crocin activates Akt signaling and thereby alleviates diabetes-induced metabolic disturbances by restoring the balance between glucose and fatty acid utilization in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic rats.

MDRDEGs were linked to AGE-RAGE signaling, RNA processing, protein transport, and energy metabolism using functional enrichment analysis. Seven MDRDEGs with significant genetic causal effects in DKD were discovered using SMR and MR analyses: ACTN1, ALG11, CCNB1, HIVEP2, MANBA, TUBA1A, and WFS1. Co-localization and scRNA-seq analyses examined these genes' DKD connections. Due to the high significance of its prediction model and DKD expression, ACTN1 was studied in depth.

The lack of effective antiviral drugs necessitates a robust therapeutic approach to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Various investigations have recognized ACE2 as the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and this amalgamation of ACE2 with the spike protein of the coronavirus is paramount for viral entry into the host cells and inducing infection. Consequently, restricting the virus's accessibility to ACE2 offers an alternative therapeutic approach to averting this illness.\nOBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify potent inhibitors with enhanced affinity for the ACE2 protein and validate their stability and efficacy against established inhibitors via molecular docking, machine learning, and MD simulations.\nMETHODOLOGY: 202 ACE2 inhibitors (PDB ID and 6LZG), comprising repurposed antiviral compounds and specific ACE2 inhibitors, were selected for molecular docking. The two most effective compounds obtained from docking were further analyzed using machine learning to identify potential compounds with enhanced ACE2-binding affinity. To refine the dataset, molecular decoys were generated through the Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E) server, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was applied for data preprocessing. The Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was then utilized to optimize the machine learning pipeline. The most promising ML-predicted compounds were re-evaluated through docking and subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate their structural stability and interactions with ACE2. Finally, these compounds were evaluated against the top two pre-established inhibitors using various computational tools.\nRESULTS: The two best pre-established inhibitors were identified as Birinapant and Elbasvir, while the best machine-learning-predicted compounds were PubChem ID: 23658468 and PubChem ID: 117637105. Pharmacophore studies were conducted on the most effective machine-learning-predicted compounds, followed by a comparative ADME/T analysis between the best ML-screened and pre-established inhibitors. The results indicated that the top ML compound (PubChem ID: 23658468) demonstrated favorable BBB permeability and a high HIA index, highlighting its potential for therapeutic applications. The ML-screened ligand demonstrated structural stability with an RMSD (0.24 nm) and greater global stability (Rg: 2.08 nm) than Birinapant. Hydrogen bonding interactions further validated their strong binding affinity. MM/PBSA analysis confirmed the ML-screened compound's stronger binding affinity, with a binding free energy of - 132.90 kcal/mol, indicating enhanced stability in complex formation.\nCONCLUSION: The results emphasize the efficacy of integrating molecular docking, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations in facilitating the rapid identification of novel inhibitors.

ADT can induce body composition change; however, the association between body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between ADT-induced body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included 681 patients with prostate cancer (410 in the derivation cohort and 271 in the external validation cohort) who underwent radiotherapy and ADT between 2008 and 2021. Computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline and 6 months post-ADT were used to assess the changes in skeletal muscle index (ΔSMI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (ΔSATI) and visceral adipose tissue index (ΔVATI) at the L3 vertebral level. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, arterial revascularization and cardiovascular death. The association between body composition changes and MACE was analysed using the SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) method and validated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: The median age was 72 years (interquartile range: 66-77). With a median follow-up of 6.0 years (derivation cohort) and 6.6 years (validation cohort), 62 (15.1%) and 39 (14.4%) patients experienced MACE, respectively. Six months post-ADT, there was a reduction in SMI, whereas SATI and VATI had increased (p < 0.001). The ΔSMI and ΔSATI were the most important features for predicting MACE in both cohorts, whereas ΔVATI and baseline body composition parameters were less influential. SMI loss was inversely correlated with MACE risk, whereas increases in SATI and VATI were positively correlated. The identified thresholds for MACE prediction were SMI loss ≥ 4.7% and SATI gain ≥ 8.2%. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, ΔSMI (hazard ratio: 1.27 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001) and ΔSATI (hazard ratio: 1.07 per 1% increase, p < 0.001) were independently associated with MACE risk; however, ΔVATI was not (hazard ratio: 0.99, p = 0.23).

While no cure exists, early diagnosis can significantly slow disease progression. Computer-aided diagnostic systems are becoming critical tools for assisting in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate recent advancements in computer-aided decision support systems for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, focusing on data modalities, machine learning methods, and performance metrics.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published between 2021 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, IEEEXplore and Web of Science, using search terms related to Alzheimer's disease classification, neuroimaging, machine learning, and diagnostic performance. A total of 39 studies met the inclusion criteria, focusing on the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease classification using machine learning models.\nRESULTS: Multimodal approaches, combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography and Cognitive assessments, outperformed single-modality studies in diagnostic accuracy reliability. Convolutional Neural Networks were the most commonly used machine learning models, followed by hybrid models and Random Forest. The highest accuracy reported for binary classification was 100%, while multi-class classification achieved up to 99.98%. Techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and data augmentation were frequently employed to address data imbalance, improving model generalizability.\nDISCUSSION: Our review highlights the advantages of using multimodal data in computer-aided decision support systems for more accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, we also identified several limitations, including data imbalance, small sample sizes, and the lack of external validation in most studies.

However, modeling EHR sequential data, that is, patient trajectories, is challenging due to the evolving relationships between diagnoses and treatments over time. Significant progress has been achieved using transformers and self-supervised learning. While BERT-inspired models using masked language modeling (MLM) capture EHR context, they often struggle with the complex temporal dynamics of disease progression and interventions.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the modeling of EHR sequences by addressing the limitations of traditional transformer-based approaches in capturing complex temporal dependencies.\nMETHODS: We introduce Trajectory Order Objective BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; TOO-BERT), a transformer-based model that advances the MLM pretraining approach by integrating a novel TOO to better learn the complex sequential dependencies between medical events. TOO-Bert enhanced the learned context by MLM by pretraining the model to distinguish ordered sequences of medical codes from permuted ones in a patient trajectory. The TOO is enhanced by a conditional selection process that focus on medical codes or visits that frequently occur together, to further improve contextual understanding and strengthen temporal awareness. We evaluate TOO-BERT on 2 extensive EHR datasets, MIMIC-IV hospitalization records and the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort (MDC)-comprising approximately 10 and 8 million medical codes, respectively. TOO-BERT is compared against conventional machine learning methods, a transformer trained from scratch, and a transformer pretrained on MLM in predicting heart failure (HF), Alzheimer disease (AD), and prolonged length of stay (PLS).\nRESULTS: TOO-BERT outperformed conventional machine learning methods and transformer-based approaches in HF, AD, and PLS prediction across both datasets. In the MDC dataset, TOO-BERT improved HF and AD prediction, increasing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores from 67.7 and 69.5 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 73.9 and 71.9, respectively. In the MIMIC-IV dataset, TOO-BERT enhanced HF and PLS prediction, raising AUC scores from 86.2 and 60.2 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 89.8 and 60.4, respectively. Notably, TOO-BERT demonstrated strong performance in HF prediction even with limited fine-tuning data, achieving AUC scores of 0.877 and 0.823, compared to 0.839 and 0.799 for the MLM-pretrained Transformer, when fine-tuned on only 50% (442/884) and 20% (176/884) of the training data, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating temporal ordering objectives into MLM-pretrained models, enabling deeper insights into the complex temporal relationships inherent in EHR data.

The venom of wasps contains a variety of bioactive compounds that can lead to a wide range of clinical effects, from mild localized pain and swelling to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in health care, including emergency medicine and toxicology. These models have the potential to assist health care professionals in making fast and informed clinical decisions. This study aimed to assess the performance of 4 leading LLMs-ERNIE Bot 3.5 (Baidu), ERNIE Bot 4.0 (Baidu), Claude Pro (Anthropic), and ChatGPT 4.0-in managing wasp sting cases, with a focus on their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and decision-making abilities.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to systematically evaluate and compare the capabilities of the 4 LLMs in the context of wasp sting management. This involved analyzing their responses to a series of standardized questions and real-world clinical scenarios. The study aimed to determine which LLMs provided the most accurate, complete, and clinically relevant information for the management of wasp stings.\nMETHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design, creating 50 standardized questions that covered 10 key domains in the management of wasp stings, along with 20 real-world clinical case scenarios. Responses from the 4 LLMs were independently evaluated by 8 domain experts, who rated them on a 5-point Likert scale based on accuracy, completeness, and usefulness in clinical decision-making. Statistical comparisons between the models were made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the consistency of expert ratings was assessed using the Kendall coefficient of concordance.\nRESULTS: Claude Pro achieved the highest average score of 4.7 (SD 0.603) out of 5, followed closely by ChatGPT 4.0 with a score of 4.5. ERNIE Bot 4.0 and ERNIE Bot 3.5 received average scores of 4 (SD 0.600) and 3.8, respectively. In analyzing the 20 complex clinical cases, Claude Pro significantly outperformed ERNIE Bot 3.5, particularly in areas such as managing complications and assessing the severity of reactions (P<.001). The expert ratings showed moderate agreement (Kendall W=0.67), indicating that the assessments were consistently reliable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that Claude Pro and ChatGPT 4.0 are highly capable of providing accurate and comprehensive support for the clinical management of wasp stings, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios.

AF can increase the risk of stroke and other serious cardiovascular complications, compromising patients' quality of life and survival. Screening of AF, both asymptomatic and symptomatic forms, is therefore essential for optimal management.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the Watch Your Heart After Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer (WATCH) study is to assess the incidence of AF (symptomatic or asymptomatic) occurring throughout a 5-year follow-up after RT and to investigate whether cardiac radiation exposure is associated with the occurrence of such events.\nMETHODS: WATCH is a cohort study that will include 200 patients over 65 years old, treated with RT for BC 5 years before inclusion and without a history of AF. Cross-sectional screening for AF at the time of the scheduled 5-year post-RT visit will be conducted by recording data from a Withings ScanWatch smartwatch for 1 month, confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG), and validated by a physician. In addition, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be performed, providing a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structures, and allowing us to investigate the underlying etiology and assess the risk of complications. Patients' medical records will provide retrospective information about the timing and risk factors for the occurrence of AF and other arrhythmias and cardiac diseases during the 5 years following RT. The development of deep learning algorithms for autosegmentation analysis of potentially critical substructures for the occurrence of AF, including cardiac chambers, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, coronary arteries, and pulmonary veins (PVs), will produce dosimetry linked to previous RT treatment for all contoured structures.\nRESULTS: Enrollment started in October 2023 and will continue until mid-2026 to include 200 patients, which will ensure an 80% statistical power to detect a significant difference in AF incidence around 15% for the group of patients moderately exposed (<75th percentile of the mean heart radiation dose) and 25% for the group of patients highly exposed (>75th percentile of the mean heart radiation dose). The results are expected by the end of 2026.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to generating new knowledge on AF after RT for BC and help considering the inclusion of AF screening into routine clinical practice for these patients.

The rising prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) highlights the need for more comprehensive treatment strategies, with a particular emphasis on supporting maternal self-management. We showed recently that a mobile app, eMOM, where glucose, nutrition, and physical activity are combined within a single app, significantly improves multiple clinical outcomes among persons with gestational diabetes.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effects of the eMOM on maternal self-discovery and learning, autonomous motivation to manage GDM, and psychological well-being. Additionally, we examine the correlation between improved maternal clinical outcomes and change in autonomous motivation. We also assess the acceptance and usability of the eMOM app.\nMETHODS: Building upon the original randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which the intervention arm used a mobile app (eMOM), we conducted a mixed methods study that included an investigation of eMOM log files, semistructured interviews on self-discovery, and an examination of questionnaires assessing motivation (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire and Perceived Competence Scale), depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), technology use and acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology questionnaire), and usability (modified Software Usability Measurement Inventory). Additionally, we monitored participants' stress levels using wearable electrocardiographic devices (FirstBeat Bodyguard 2). A total of 148 individuals participated in the original RCTs, with 76 in the intervention arm and 72 in the control arm. From the intervention arm, 18 participants were randomly selected for interviews in this study.\nRESULTS: Results show that the use rate of eMOM was high, and novel visualization supported self-discovery in persons with GDM. Most participants (17/18, 94%) indicated that the eMOM app helped to find the associations between their daily activities and glucose levels. Especially having nutrition visualized together with glucose was highly appreciated. Participants also reported learning about the associations between physical activity and glucose levels. No differences were observed between the intervention and control arms in autonomous motivation, depression, or stress. Furthermore, there were no correlations between improved clinical outcomes and changes in motivation. Accessibility and usability ratings were consistently high throughout the intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: The eMOM mobile app combining data from continuous glucose monitor, food diary, and physical activity tracker supports maternal self-discovery related to GDM without contributing to depression or adding extra stress.

Traditional scheduling methods often fail to consider individual preferences, leading to dissatisfaction, burnout, and high turnover. Inadequate scheduling practices, including restricted autonomy and lack of transparency, can further reduce nurse morale and negatively affect patient outcomes. Research suggests that participative scheduling approaches incorporating nurse preferences can improve job satisfaction. Artificial intelligence (AI) and mathematical optimization methods, such as mixed-integer programming (MIP), constraint programming (CP), genetic programming (GP), and reinforcement learning (RL), offer potential solutions to optimize scheduling and address these challenges.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a framework for integrating nurses' preferences into AI-supported scheduling methods by gathering qualitative insights from nurses and supervisors and mapping these to mathematical and AI-based scheduling techniques.\nMETHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted with 21 participants (nurses, supervisors, and temporary staff) from Swiss health care institutions to understand experiences and preferences related to staff scheduling. Qualitative data were analyzed using open and axial coding to extract key themes. These themes were then mapped to AI methodologies, including MIP, CP, GP, and RL, based on their suitability to address identified scheduling challenges.\nRESULTS: The study revealed key priorities in nurse scheduling. Fairness and participation were highlighted by 85% (18/21) of interview participants, emphasizing the need for transparent and inclusive scheduling. Flexibility and autonomy were preferred by 76% (16/21), favoring shift swaps and self-scheduling. AI expectations were mixed: 62% (13/21) saw potential for improved efficiency and fairness, while 38% (8/21) expressed concerns over reliability and loss of human oversight. Mapping to AI methods showed MIP as effective for fair shift allocation, CP for complex rule-based conditions, GP for handling unforeseen absences, and RL for dynamic schedule adaptation in hospital environments. A preliminary AI implementation of MIP in a training hospital unit (35 staff members) showed how to design a system from a mathematical perspective.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-supported scheduling systems can significantly enhance fairness, transparency, and efficiency in nurse scheduling. However, concerns regarding AI reliability, adaptability to individual needs, and human oversight must be addressed. A hybrid approach integrating AI recommendations with human decision-making may be optimal.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are utilized to measure patient core musculature as a measurement of sarcopenia. Methods to extract information on core body musculature can be through either freehand region-of-interest (ROI) or machine learning algorithms to quantitate total body muscle within a given area. This study directly compares these two collection methods leveraging length of stay (LOS) outcomes previously found to be associated with freehand ROI measurements.\nMETHODS: A total of 50 individuals were included who underwent liver transplantation from our single center between January 1, 2016, and May 30, 2021, and had a non-contrast abdominal CT scan within 6-months of surgery. CT-derived skeletal muscle measures at the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained using freehand ROI and an automated deep learning system.\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis of freehand psoas muscle measures, psoas area index (PAI) and mean Hounsfield units (mHU), were significantly correlated to the automated deep learning system's total skeletal muscle measures at the level of the L3, skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD), respectively (R2 = 0.4221; p value < 0.0001; R2 = 0.6297; p value < 0.0001). The automated deep learning model's SMI predicted ∼20% of the variability (R2 = 0.2013; hospital length of stay) while the PAI variable only predicted about 10% of the variability (R2 = 0.0919; total healthcare length of stay) of the length of stay variables. In contrast, both the freehand ROI mHU and the automated deep learning model's muscle density variables were associated with ∼20% of the variability in the inpatient length of stay (R2 = 0.2383 and 0.1810, respectively) and total healthcare length of stay variables (R2 = 0.2190 and 0.1947, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Sarcopenia measurements represent an important risk stratification tool for liver transplantation outcomes.

It is the major cause of chronic kidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney replacement therapy.\nMAIN BODY: In DKD, numerous dysbalanced metabolic, haemodynamic, inflammatory signalling pathways, and molecular mediators interconnect, creating a feedback loop that promotes general kidney damage. Hyperglycaemia is the primary trigger for DKD and leads gradually to oxidative stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis, glomerular hypertension, and intrarenal hypoxia. Key interconnected metabolic pathways are the hyperglycaemia-mediated polyol, hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation end-products pathway hyperactivity. Concurrently, hyperglycaemia-induced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation, alters the kidney intraglomerular haemodynamic leading to inflammation through Toll-like receptors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor-beta-mediated excessive extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. The resulting death signals trigger apoptosis and autophagy through Hippo, Notch, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and microRNA dysregulation. These signals synergistically remodel the kidneys culminating in intrarenal hypoxia, podocyte dysfunction, hyperfiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and loss of kidney function. The resulting renal failure further upregulates these death pathways and mediators, giving rise to a vicious cycle that further worsens DKD.\nCONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the primary molecular mediators and signalling pathways leading to DKD; their interconnectivity at the onset and during DKD progression, the central role of transforming growth factor-beta via different pathways, the Hippo pathway kidney-specific response to hyperglycaemia, and how all mediators and transduction signals result in a vicious circle that exacerbates renal failure. The review gives therapeutic sights to these pathways as druggable targets for DKD management.

Imaging studies have yielded varied results, and it is now clear that there is unlikely to be one characteristic neuroanatomical profile of either condition. Parsing this heterogeneity could allow us to identify more homogeneous subgroups, either within or across conditions, which may be more clinically informative. This has been a pivotal goal for neurodevelopmental research using both clinical and neuroanatomical features, though results thus far have again been inconsistent with regards to the number and characteristics of subgroups.\nMETHODS: Here, we use population modelling to cluster a multi-site dataset based on global and regional centile scores of cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume. We use HYDRA, a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which clusters based on differences to controls and compare its performance to a traditional clustering approach.\nRESULTS: We identified distinct subgroups within autism and ADHD, as well as across diagnosis, often with opposite neuroanatomical alterations relatively to controls. These subgroups were characterised by different combinations of increased or decreased patterns of morphometrics. We did not find significant clinical differences across subgroups.\nLIMITATIONS: Crucially, however, the number of subgroups and their membership differed vastly depending on chosen features and the algorithm used, highlighting the impact and importance of careful method selection.\nCONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in autism and ADHD and demonstrate that population modelling is a useful tool to study subgrouping in autism and ADHD.

Secondary objectives included assessing changes in probing depth (PD) and identifying risk factors associated with TLP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using patient records from the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. Included were 283 patients (mean age: 53.2 years) with periodontal breakdown during SPT (PiKS) who underwent single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic instrumentation. The primary outcome was TLP over a mean follow-up of 19.4 years. Secondary outcomes included changes in PD (≥ 5 mm and ≥ 6 mm) and identification of risk factors for tooth loss. Statistical analyses used multilevel binary logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and linear regression models.\nRESULTS: Among 283 patients (mean age: 53.2 years), the mean TLP was 0.9 teeth per patient over a mean follow-up of 19.4 years. Factors significantly associated with TLP included diabetes (OR = 2.41; p = 0.013), current smoking (OR = 2.13; p = 0.025), higher periodontitis Grades B and C (OR = 3.31; p = 0.001), and Stages III-IV (OR = 8.67; p = 0.001). Baseline pocket depths (PD) ≥ 5 mm (OR = 1.13; p = 0.002) and ≥ 6 mm (OR = 1.29; p = 0.001) were also associated with higher TLP. Each additional annual SPT visit reduced the TLP risk by half (OR = 0.50; p = 0.003). PD ≥ 5 mm showed minimal increase change (0.16; p = 0.02), while depths ≥ 6 mm actually decreased (-0.10; p = 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Single-visit full-mouth non-surgical therapy is effective for long-term management of PiKS, with low tooth loss rates. Diabetes, smoking, advanced periodontitis stage/grade, and deeper baseline pockets are key predictors of TLP. Frequent SPT visits significantly mitigate tooth loss risk.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: During (SPT) appointments, prevalent practice involves the full-mouth instrumentation of persistent periodontal pockets to disrupt microbial populations and consequently reduce the inflammatory response responsible for disease progression. This study investigates the efficacy of single-visit full-mouth instrumentation as a potential alternative to standard practices in controlling periodontal disease during SPT, which have potential benefits for patients, including reduced treatment time, improved adherence to maintenance therapy, and comprehensive management of periodontal disease. By minimizing the number of visits, this approach may enhance patient compliance while reducing the risk of reinfection from untreated sites between sessions, ultimately contributing to better long-term periodontal stability. Factors such as deeper baseline probing depths and crucial risk elements for TLP-including diabetes, smoking, and advanced stages (III-IV) and grades (B and C) of periodontitis, can play a role in TLP. Additionally, this study provides valuable insights into the customization of more intensive interventions for patients at higher risk. Our findings highlight the importance of frequent SPT visits, with each additional annual visit halving the risk of TLP. The observed reduction in PD of ≥ 6 mm following treatment indicates the significant potential of comprehensive debridement for enhancing long-term periodontal stability.

Despite extensive research, its pathogenesis and treatment remain only partially understood, driving continued investigation throughout 2024. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system has been linked to chronic stress responses and neuroinflammation, with neuroimaging and preclinical studies confirming altered pain and stress processing. Low-grade inflammation and metabolic disturbances, including cytokine imbalance and increased adipose tissue infiltration, further exacerbate symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota contribute to immune and emotional dysregulation. MRI studies continue to reveal brain changes that differentiate FM from other chronic pain disorders. Multi-omics approaches, including transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, show promise as diagnostic biomarkers. Mitochondrial dysfunction also emerges as a key factor, since impaired energy metabolism seems to correlate with symptom severity. From a clinical perspective, recent studies have explored under-recognised aspects of FM, such as sexual and cognitive dysfunction, the role of gender, environmental exposures, and the disease's impact on relationships and family life. The differential diagnosis of FM and long COVID has ignited discussion about potential shared mechanisms. Conversely, residual pain in inflammatory diseases remains insufficiently addressed.

Although aggregating data from different institutions could alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles.\nPURPOSE: This work aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in radiotherapy treatment planning.\nMETHODS: We implemented a unified communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer communication.

Data on treatment variation across centers are unknown. This study investigated treatment variation across hospitals and its effect on overall survival (OS) in the Netherlands by conducting a nationwide retrospective cohort study with population-based data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients diagnosed with synchronous metastatic EC/GC between 2015 and 2022 were included. Multilevel logistic regression assessed treatment patterns according to hospital of diagnosis. OS was analyzed using Cox regression analysis after categorizing hospitals into tertiles based on their adjusted odds (low/medium/high) for systemic treatment (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy). Among 8406 EC and 3871 GC patients, the proportion receiving systemic treatment varied substantially: 19.8%-69.6% for EC and 15.8%-81.3% for GC across hospitals. Hospital of diagnosis was significantly associated with the adjusted probability of receiving systemic treatment (p < .0001). Ten out of 78 EC (12.8%) and 7 out of 73 (9.6%) GC hospitals had significantly lower systemic treatment probabilities. EC patients with OS ≥4 months diagnosed at hospitals with lower probabilities had significantly worse OS compared to high-probability hospitals (hazard ratios [HR] 0.87 [0.79-0.95] p = .002). GC patients from low-probability hospitals had significantly worse OS than from medium- (HR 0.86 [0.76-0.96], p = .011) or high-probability hospitals (HR 0.73 [0.64-0.82], p < .0001).
