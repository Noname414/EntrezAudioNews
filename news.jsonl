Identifying refracture risk is crucial for implementing effective preventive strategies. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of refracture following an initial vertebral fragility fracture.\nMETHODS: The study included both men and women, focusing on individuals aged 60 and above. The fractures were diagnosed using X-rays. Participants from three centers were used for model development, while the fourth center was used for validation. The discrimination and calibration of each model was assessed using the validation set. A predictive model for preoperative refracture risk was developed using logistic regression analysis and visualized via a nomogram.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,632 participants with a median age of 72 years were enrolled, of whom 428 had experienced a refracture. Eleven factors were identified as significant predictors of refracture: age, rehabilitation status, treatment regimen, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), duration of medication use, history of comorbidities, fall risk, and levels of bone gla protein (BGP), total alkaline phosphatase (TALP), and homocysteine (Hcy).

This study combines cross-sectional and meta-analytic methods to comprehensively explore the relationship between DN and osteoporosis in T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study included 523 T2DM patients, classified into DN and non-DN groups. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and multivariate analysis identified osteoporosis-related factors. The meta-analysis included studies published from 1999 to 2021, comparing BMD between patients with and without DN. The results showed that while significant differences in clinical characteristics and biochemical indices (such as age, HbA1c, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels) were observed between the groups, no significant association between DN and osteoporosis was found after adjusting for covariates like body mass index and blood pressure. Additionally, the meta-analysis confirmed no significant impact of DN on BMD across skeletal sites, including the lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck.

However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.\nOBJECTIVES: This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.\nMETHODS: We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.\nRESULTS: A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption.

Web-based interventions (WBIs) can be used to achieve this goal.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the treatment needs of young people with GD in Germany and derive implications for the development of a self-guided WBI for GD.\nMETHODS: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted a focus group with 3 young male adults and semistructured individual interviews with 3 male adolescents. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The reporting of this study followed the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines.\nRESULTS: Participants' expectations of web-based help in general and of a self-guided WBI for GD revealed a wide variety of sometimes conflicting user needs. For example, by analyzing participants' experiences with successful strategies, we found that external stabilizers (eg, parental control and support group meetings) were helpful in managing GD. However, with regard to a WBI, participants described it as a barrier if the WBI created \"too much pressure.\" On the other hand, \"not enough pressure\" (ie, not enough external control) was also mentioned as a barrier. The belief that gaming is rewarding and that only equally rewarding activities are successful alternatives to gaming is in tension with the fact that changing problematic gaming behavior can be stressful and not feel rewarding at all. The data also showed that, on the one hand, a WBI should be designed to be attractive (eg, by incorporating gaming elements) but that it should not be too attractive as this, in turn, could trigger GD.\nCONCLUSIONS: A self-guided WBI for GD should consider and address conflicting user needs. Ambivalence of needs in the face of coping with GD should not be seen as a problem but as a normal part of a change process and, therefore, actively integrated into the WBI concept and storyline.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00032334; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00032334.", "authors": ["Geisler Birte Linny", "Petersen Kay Uwe", "Hanke Sara", "Schurer Simon", "Schreiber Anne", "Lämmle Christine", "Batra Anil", "Renner Tobias", "Brandhorst Isabel"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "矛盾的使用者需求：設計網路成癮網路介入措施的挑戰與機遇——青少年與年輕成人之質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "本研究探討德國網路遊戲成癮青少年和年輕人對網路介入治療的需求。研究發現，使用者對於網路介入抱持著複雜且矛盾的期望。例如，他們需要外部支持（如家長控制和支持團體），但同時又排斥過度的壓力。他們認為遊戲本身具有吸引力，但網路介入又不能過於吸引人，以免反過來觸發成癮行為。研究結論指出，設計網路遊戲成癮的網路介入措施時，應考慮並處理這些矛盾的需求。將這些矛盾視為改變過程中的正常現象，並將其納入網路介入的設計和故事主線中，才能更有效地幫助使用者。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果你的孩子沉迷遊戲，這個研究可以幫助你設計一個既能引導孩子，又不會讓他們反感的網路戒癮計畫，就像一個溫柔的導師，而不是嚴厲的監管者。", "很多年輕人想戒掉遊戲癮，但又覺得很難。這個研究就像一份客製化的地圖，告訴設計師如何打造一個既有趣又能幫助他們擺脫遊戲的網路工具，讓戒癮不再是痛苦的掙扎，而是一場有趣的冒險。", "對於開發網路戒癮App的公司來說，這項研究提供寶貴的洞察，讓他們知道如何設計出真正符合使用者需求的產品，避免一味地強制控制，而是創造一個更人性化、更有效的解決方案。"], "audio": "audios/40418804.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:40:59.790015"}

As medical knowledge expands, clinicians are increasingly using evidence-based point-of-care information (POCI) resources to facilitate clinical decision-making in medical practices. While these tools can improve clinical outcomes, few studies have assessed clinicians' opinions on integrating them with EHRs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess clinicians' attitudes and the perceived value of POCI resources for finding medication- and disease-related information in clinical practice and their integration with EHRs.\nMETHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 clinicians from various roles and specialties between December 2021 and January 2022 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. A content analysis approach was used to examine participants' responses and feedback on their current use of POCI resources, barriers and facilitators, mobile app use, and recommendations for improved integration.\nRESULTS: Of the 10 participants, 6 (60%) were female, 9 (90%) were aged <40 years, and 8 (80%) had ≤10 years of experience in clinical practice. While UpToDate was the most preferred disease-related information resource (n=9, 90%), preferences for medication-related resources varied, with 2 (20%) participants favoring Micromedex, 2 (20%) favoring Lexicomp, 2 (20%) favoring Brigham and Women's Hospital-specific drug administration guidelines, 2 (20%) favoring UpToDate, and 1 (10%) favoring Medscape. Most participants used their preferred tools weekly. Most clinicians preferred comprehensive POCI tools with clear, navigable layouts that eased and quickened the search for information. Features such as heavy text density, the lack of citations, and frequent log-ins to access the tool were viewed as barriers that limited content legibility, credibility, and accessibility. Access-related, tool-specific, and integration-related barriers were reported to negatively impact clinical workflow. Most (n=8, 80%) of the participants reported currently using mobile apps, reasoning that they facilitated quick and convenient searches for information; however, frequent updates, time-consuming log-ins, and high text density on smaller screens posed challenges. Most participants favored further integration of POCI resources with EHRs, with all reporting them being currently available as embedded links that launch externally. Some recommended that further integration would allow us to leverage existing POCI tool features, such as chatbots and knowledge links, as well as aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as predictive algorithms and personalized alert systems, to enhance EHR functionality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants favored integration to improve usability and optimize workplace efficiency by reducing the amount of time spent seeking answers to their medication- and disease-related questions. Recommendations on integration highlighted the need for stakeholder input in developing clinical decision support tools and interfaces that leverage advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning while not compromising user experience or increasing time spent on tasks.", "authors": ["Marceau Marlika", "Dulgarian Sevan", "Cambre Jacob", "Garabedian Pamela M", "Amato Mary G", "Seger Diane L", "Volk Lynn A", "Jackson Gretchen Purcell", "Bates David W", "Rozenblum Ronen", "Syrowatka Ania"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "臨床醫師對於照護點資訊資源的態度和認知及其與電子健康紀錄整合：一項質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究探討了臨床醫師對於在臨床實務中使用照護點資訊資源（POCI）的看法，以及將這些資源整合到電子健康紀錄（EHR）中的價值。研究團隊在波士頓Brigham and Women's Hospital訪談了10位不同職位和專科的臨床醫師。研究發現，UpToDate是最受歡迎的疾病資訊資源，而藥物資訊資源的選擇則較為分散。醫師們偏好內容全面、排版清晰的POCI工具，但認為文字過於密集、缺乏引用以及頻繁登入等問題會影響使用體驗。多數醫師使用手機App來快速搜尋資訊，但也面臨更新頻繁、登入耗時等挑戰。大家普遍支持將POCI資源與EHR進一步整合，以提升可用性、減少尋找資訊的時間，並建議利用人工智慧和機器學習技術來強化EHR的功能。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果醫生在看診時，需要的藥物資訊或疾病知識，不用再花時間翻書或上網查，而是直接在電腦系統裡就能快速找到，就像有個隨身醫療百科全書一樣，這就能幫助醫生更有效率地做出正確的診斷和治療。", "如果你今天去看醫生，醫生可以透過整合的系統，快速了解最新的治療方法和藥物資訊，這表示你接受到的醫療照護是與時俱進的，不會因為醫生太忙或資訊落後而延誤病情。", "醫院可以利用這個研究結果，設計出更好用的電子病歷系統，讓醫生更容易找到需要的資訊，減少錯誤發生的機率，最終提升整體醫療品質，讓病人得到更好的照顧。"], "audio": "audios/40418791.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:41:10.349412"}

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-efficiency of bDMARD dose reduction in patients with AS and apply machine learning to identify key factors influencing disease control.\nMETHODS: This 12-month prospective study, 368 AS patients receiving ≥ 3 months of full-dose bDMARDs were included. Among 215 initial responders (ASDAS < 2.1), 146 underwent dose reduction while 69 continued full-dose therapy. Clinical outcomes such as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) and ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) were assessed, along with cost effectiveness using incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER). Random forest models were developed to predict the achievement of inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) and to identify key predictors.\nRESULTS: The dose reduction group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in CRP (-4.05 vs. +2.83 mg/L, p < 0.001), BASDAI (-3.00 vs. +0.89, p < 0.001), and ASDAS (-1.42 vs. +0.09, p < 0.001) compared to the full dose group.

Previous studies have described disruption of the norms of academic publishing during this time. This study uses an epidemiological statistical toolkit alongside machine-learning methods to investigate the functioning of the scientific information-generation and -consumption ecosystem throughout the pandemic.\nMETHODS: A dataset of 17 million scientific research papers that were published between January 2019 and December 2022 was analysed. Data on citations and Altmetrics were harvested, and topic modelling was applied to abstracts. COVID-19-related articles were identified from title text. We investigated publication dynamics, correlations between citation metrics and Altmetrics, rates of publication in preprints, and temporal trends in topics, and compared these metrics in COVID-19 papers vs non-COVID-19 papers.\nRESULTS: Throughout 2020-2, 3.7% of English-language research output was on the topic of COVID-19. Journal articles on COVID-19 were published at a consistent rate during this period, while preprints peaked in early 2020 and decreased thereafter. COVID-19 preprints had lower publication rates in the peer-reviewed literature than other preprints, particularly those that were preprinted during early 2020. COVID-19 research received significantly more media and social media attention than non-COVID-19 research, and preprints received more attention, on average, than journal articles, with attention peaking during the initial wave and subsequent peaks corresponding to the emergence of novel variants. COVID-19 articles exhibited a higher correlation between Altmetrics and citation metrics compared with non-COVID-19 publications, suggesting a strong alignment between scientific and public attention.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of the rapid expansion of COVID-19 research, revealing evolving research areas and waxing and waning public interest across different topics.

Nevertheless, conventional epilepsy seizure detection approaches face difficulties such as poor epilepsy seizure detection accuracy and higher computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a novel TransseizNet framework for epilepsy seizure detection from the electroencephalography signal.\nMETHODS: The electroencephalography data from three datasets are pre-processed using the Savitzky-Golay filter. The proposed framework utilizes the Empirical Tunable Q-Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition, which is the combination of the Empirical Wavelet Transform and the Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform. This enhances time-frequency resolution and adaptively captures localized oscillatory patterns critical for precise seizure detection. The proposed framework utilizes a Wavelet-Graph Convolutional Network Vision Transformer for epilepsy seizure detection and classification. The integration of wavelet-driven attention with graph-based learning enhances spatial-temporal feature representation, which makes seizure detection more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient than the baseline approaches.\nRESULTS: The TransseizNet model is trained and validated on three datasets and achieves an average accuracy of 98.65% a precision of 98.59%, a F1-score of 98.45%, a recall of 98.30%, a specificity of 98.52%, a computational time of 17 sec, and the detection latency of 2.5 sec, which outperforms the performance of baseline approaches in the detection of epileptic seizures.\nDISCUSSION: TransseizNet framework provides superior performance in seizure detection by efficiently integrating adaptive frequency decomposition and hybrid deep learning.

However, cancer researchers still face a significant challenge in accurately predicting breast cancer patients' survival rates. The purpose was to predict breast cancer survival using a Bayesian network.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 2,995 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently hospitalized between January 1, 2012, and December 30, 2024. SPSS Modeler version 18.0 was used to build prediction models. The data were randomly split into a training set (2,097 cases, 70%) and a test set (898 cases, 30%) for developing the Bayesian network model and predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The model included demographic variables (age, marital status, and governorate), laboratory/clinical variables (hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, presence of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) and the outcome variable, patient survival status (binary value: survived/died). The discriminative ability of models was evaluated by accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) in terms of superior predictive performance for breast cancer outcomes.\nRESULTS: The Bayesian model exhibited the best discriminatory performance among the nine models, with an AUC of 0.859 and the highest accuracy of 96.661%. In the context of feature importance, white blood cell value at the time of diagnosis was the most important feature for predicting the survival of breast cancer. Patients who had below-normal hemoglobin and above-normal white blood count values had a higher death probability than patients who had normal white blood count and hemoglobin values. The presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with breast cancer led to a reduced survival probability.\nCONCLUSION: The Bayesian model outperformed the other models in predicting the survival probability of breast cancer.

However, prenatal screening is prone to inaccuracies, leading to potentially unnecessary interventions. This study aims to evaluate the factors influencing the accuracy of third-trimester screening for LGA fetuses to improving diagnostic accuracy.\nMETHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted involving low-risk pregnancies from three hospitals. Screening was analyzed using ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC) and symphysial fundal height (SFH) measurements. EFW and AC were assessed either during the routine third-trimester ultrasound or during an additional growth ultrasound when available. Newborns were classified as LGA based on AUDIPOG growth curves. Screening performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), Youden's index and accuracy. We also evaluated composite screening tests combining biometric parameters with maternal clinical risk factors and influence of gestational age at the time of growth ultrasound to identify the optimal timing for screening.\nRESULTS: Among 2,217 women, risk factors such as high BMI and gestational diabetes increased suspicion of LGA fetuses, contributing to both true and false positive results (p<0.001). No single ultrasound parameter demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. Third-trimester ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 37 % [31-44 %] and a specificity of 94 % [93-95 %], while growth ultrasound improved sensitivity to 65 % [57-74 %] but reduced specificity to 82 % [79-85 %]. SFH measurements did not enhance screening performance. Overestimation of fetal weight was observed in 56.89 % (95/167) of cases, with errors exceeding 10 % in 26.95 % (122/167) of newborns. Combined screening using fetal biometry and maternal clinical risk factors showed high specificity but poor sensitivity, limiting their utility as standalone tools for detecting macrosomia.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the impact of operator bias in LGA screening, with risk factors influencing measurements. The modest performance of ultrasound-based screening highlights the inherent limitations of current methods.

Among them, the control group used videos for skill acquisition, and the ChatGPT group used ChatGPT in addition to the videos. After 1 week of intervention, skills were tested using desktop virtual reality, and cognitive load was measured by recording changes in pupil diameter with an eye tracker. In addition, a spatial ability test was administered to analyze the effect of ChatGPT on those with different spatial abilities. Finally, a questionnaire was also used to assess cognitive load and self-efficacy during the learning process.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 dental undergraduates from a top-tier Chinese university were initially recruited for the experiment by October 25, 2024.

While deep learning techniques improve the accuracy of segmentation, traditional voxel-based segmentation and surface reconstruction pipelines tend to introduce artifacts such as disconnected regions, topological inconsistencies, and stepped distortions. To overcome these challenges, we propose ToPoMesh, an end-to-end 3D mesh reconstruction deep learning framework for direct reconstruction of high-fidelity surface meshes from CT volume data. To address the existing problems, our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) accurate local and global shape modeling by preserving and enhancing local feature information through residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks; (2) an adaptive variant density (Avd) mesh de-pooling strategy, which dynamically optimizes the vertex distribution; (3) a topology modification module that iteratively prunes the error surfaces and boundary smoothing via variable regularity terms to obtain finer mesh surfaces. Experiments on the LiTS, MSD pancreas tumor, MSD hippocampus, and MSD spleen datasets demonstrate that ToPoMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate a 57.4% reduction in Chamfer distance (liver) and a 0.47% improvement in F-score compared to end-to-end 3D reconstruction methods, while qualitative results confirm enhanced fidelity for thin structures and complex anatomical topologies versus segmentation frameworks.

During phase 1, participants received an online weight loss program. Those who achieved 5% or greater weight loss in phase 1 were eligible for phase 2, the actual 18-month WLM trial. Participants in the maintenance trial were randomized to either an entirely patient-delivered lifestyle intervention for WLM or SOC delivered by professional staff.

Nevertheless, its comprehensive roles in pan-cancer progression, underlying biological functions, and potential as a predictor of immunotherapy response remains poorly understood.\nMETHODS: We performed a comprehensive multi-omics pan-cancer analysis of CCT5 across 33 cancer types, integrating bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics data. CCT5 expression patterns, prognostic relevance, stemness association, and immune microenvironment relationships were evaluated. A novel CCT5-based signature (CCT5.Sig) was developed using machine learning on 23 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohorts (n = 1394) spanning eight cancer types. Model performance was assessed using AUC metrics and survival analyses.\nRESULTS: CCT5 was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues and primarily localized to malignant and cycling cells. High CCT5 expression correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers and was enriched in oncogenic, cell cycle, and DNA damage repair pathways. CCT5 expression was positively associated with mRNAsi, mDNAsi, and CytoTRACE scores, indicating a role in stemness maintenance.

If patients' seizures localize to a discrete brain region, termed a seizure onset zone, resection may be curative. Localization is often confirmed with stereotactic electroencephalography; however, this may require patients to stay in the hospital for weeks to capture spontaneous seizures. Automated localization of seizure onset zones could therefore improve presurgical evaluation and decrease morbidity.\nMETHODS: Using more than 1 000 000 interictal stereotactic electroencephalography segments collected from 78 patients, we performed five-fold cross-validation and testing on a multichannel, multiscale, one-dimensional convolutional neural network to classify seizure onset zones.\nRESULTS: Across held-out test sets, our models achieved a seizure onset zone classification sensitivity of .702 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .549-.805), specificity of .741 (95% CI = .652-.835), and accuracy of .738 (95% CI = .687-.795), which was significantly better than models trained on random labels. The models performed well across the entire brain, with top five region performance demonstrating accuracies between 70.0% and 88.4%. When split by outcomes, the models performed significantly better on patients with favorable Engel outcomes after resection or who were responsive neurostimulation responders. Finally, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) value analysis on median-normalized input data assigned consistently high feature importance to interictal spikes and large deflections, whereas similar analyses on histogram-equalized data revealed differences in feature importance assignments to low-amplitude segments.\nSIGNIFICANCE: This work serves as evidence that deep learning on brief interictal intracranial data can classify seizure onset zones across the brain.

However, public attitudes toward AI, including trust and risk perception, are key to its ethical and effective adoption. Despite growing interest, empirical research on the factors shaping public support for AI in health care (particularly in large-scale, representative contexts) remains limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate public attitudes toward AI in patient health care, focusing on how AI attributes (autonomy, costs, reliability, and transparency) shape perceptions of support, risk, and personalized care. In addition, it examines the moderating role of sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, educational level, migration background, and subjective health status) in these evaluations. Our study offers novel insights into the relative importance of AI system characteristics for public attitudes and acceptance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a factorial vignette experiment with a probability-based survey of 3030 participants from Germany's general population. Respondents were presented with hypothetical scenarios involving AI applications in diagnosis and treatment in a hospital setting. Linear regression models assessed the relative influence of AI attributes on the dependent variables (support, risk perception, and personalized care), with additional subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity by sociodemographic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Mean values between 4.2 and 4.4 on a 1-7 scale indicate a generally neutral to slightly negative stance toward AI integration in terms of general support, risk perception, and personalized care expectations, with responses spanning the full scale from strong support to strong opposition. Among the 4 dimensions, reliability emerges as the most influential factor (percentage of explained variance [EV] of up to 10.5%). Respondents expect AI to not only prevent errors but also exceed current reliability standards while strongly disapproving of nontraceable systems (transparency is another important factor, percentage of EV of up to 4%). Costs and autonomy play a comparatively minor role (percentage of EVs of up to 1.5% and 1.3%), with preferences favoring collaborative AI systems over autonomous ones, and higher costs generally leading to rejection. Heterogeneity analysis reveals limited sociodemographic differences, with education and migration background influencing attitudes toward transparency and autonomy, and gender differences primarily affecting cost-related perceptions. Overall, attitudes do not substantially differ between AI applications in diagnosis versus treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study fills a critical research gap by identifying the key factors that shape public trust and acceptance of AI in health care, particularly reliability, transparency, and patient-centered approaches.

Models using pre-vaccination antibody haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres against the vaccine strain alone poorly predict post-vaccination responses.\nMETHODS: We combined fifteen prior H3N2 influenza vaccine studies from 1997 to 2021, collectively containing 20,000 data points, and develop of a machine learning model that uses pre-vaccination HAI titres against multiple influenza variants to predict post-vaccination responses. To further test the model, four new vaccine studies were conducted in 2022-2023 spanning two geographic locations and three influenza vaccine types.\nFINDINGS: The most predictive pre-vaccination features were HAI titres against the vaccine strain and against historical influenza variants, with smaller predictive power derived from age, sex, vaccine dose, and geographic location. The resulting model predicted future responses even when the vaccine strain or vaccine formulation changed. A pre-vaccination feature-the time between peak HAI across recent variants-distinguished large versus small post-vaccination responses with 73% accuracy. Model predictions against prior vaccine studies had 2.4-fold error (95% CI: 2.34-2.40x, no large outliers with >4-fold error), yielding more accurate and robust predictions than a null model with 3.2-fold error (95% CI: 3.12-3.21x, 12% large outliers). The four new vaccine studies presented here were predicted with comparable accuracy to the intrinsic 2-fold error of the experimental assay.\nINTERPRETATION: A person's pre-vaccination influenza HAI titres using multiple variants are highly predictive of their post-vaccination response. Many individuals exhibited little-to-no vaccine response, as exhibited by the null model's accuracy, yet the machine learning model identified and accurately predicted both weak and strong responses with statistical superiority.

China's rapid technological adoption, large population, and supportive government policies position it as a potential global leader in DTx. However, challenges remain in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, product development, and reimbursement models. A comprehensive assessment of clinical evidence, commercialization trends, and regulatory frameworks is essential for understanding China's evolving DTx ecosystem and its global implications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews and analyzes the DTx landscape in China, focusing on clinical trials, commercial products, regulatory frameworks, and pricing and reimbursement models. The findings provide insights for countries aiming to develop, regulate, and integrate DTx solutions into health care systems.\nMETHODS: This comprehensive review integrates multiple methodological approaches to examine different aspects of the DTx ecosystem in China. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate clinical trials, searching PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until July 2024. Meta-analyses used random-effects models, reporting results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. For commercial products, a scoping review using the National Medical Products Administration database was performed. Regulatory policies were systematically identified through a manual review of official government sources, while pricing and reimbursement models were analyzed through a comprehensive assessment of public and private insurance policies, government initiatives, and commercial pathways.\nRESULTS: : A total of 96 clinical trials on DTx in China were identified, with cognitive disorders (n=21, 22%) and diabetes (n=20, 21%) being the most frequently studied, followed by cardiovascular diseases (n=8, 8%), sleeping disorders (n=6, 6%), and smoking cessation (n=6, 6%). Meta-analysis for diabetes DTx showed a trend toward improved hemoglobin A1c levels in digital intervention groups compared to controls (SMD -0.96, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.11) but did not reach statistical significance (I²=97%). Meta-analysis for cognitive disorder DTx showed significant improvement in global cognitive function in DTx-treated participants (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-0.94), despite notable heterogeneity (I²=71.7%). The commercial landscape analysis identified 97 active DTx solutions, primarily targeting cognitive impairment (38 companies), ophthalmic diseases (30 companies), and respiratory diseases (5 companies). The regulatory review highlighted China's reliance on general medical device policies under the National Medical Products Administration rather than DTx-specific regulations, with emerging regional innovation policies supporting industry growth. Pricing analysis revealed diverse reimbursement models, including value-based pricing, private insurance partnerships, and government-facilitated programs.\nCONCLUSIONS: China has made substantial progress in DTx development but still faces challenges in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, and reimbursement. Key factors driving DTx adoption include targeted indications, standardized clinical trials, streamlined regulation, and diversified pricing models. China's experience provides valuable lessons for other countries with emerging digital health ecosystems as they develop DTx research, regulations, and integration strategies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42024615584; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024615584.", "authors": ["Jiang Nan", "Yu Xiru", "Yang Yuxi", "Li Guanqiao", "He Chanchan", "Wang Man Ping", "Tham Yih Chung", "Wong Tien Yin", "Rao Keqin"], "published_date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "中國的數位療法：綜合回顧", "summary_zh": "數位療法(DTx)是透過軟體提供個人化、實證治療的創新方法。中國在數位療法領域具有巨大潛力，擁有龐大人口、快速發展的科技以及政府的支持政策。本研究全面回顧了中國數位療法的發展現況，包括臨床試驗、商業產品、法規框架以及定價與報銷模式。研究發現，中國在認知障礙和糖尿病等領域的數位療法臨床試驗數量最多，並在改善認知功能方面顯示出顯著效果。目前中國數位療法主要依賴現有的醫療器材法規，但各地區也開始出現支持產業發展的創新政策。儘管中國在數位療法發展上取得顯著進展，但在臨床試驗標準化、法規批准和報銷方面仍面臨挑戰。本研究結果可為其他國家發展數位療法提供寶貴經驗。", "applications": ["想像一下，阿茲海默症的早期患者，不用每天跑醫院，透過手機App就能進行認知訓練，延緩病情惡化，這就是數位療法帶來的便利。", "糖尿病患者常常需要頻繁監測血糖和調整飲食，現在透過數位療法App，可以獲得個人化的飲食建議和運動計畫，幫助他們更好地控制血糖，減少併發症的風險。", "有些小朋友有注意力不足過動症(ADHD)，透過數位遊戲，可以訓練他們的專注力，改善學習效率，而且是在輕鬆有趣的環境下進行，讓治療不再枯燥乏味。"], "audio": "audios/40424619.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T01:19:29.690839"}

FGR in patients with preeclampsia increases the risk of neonatal-perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, previous prediction methods for FGR are class-biased or clinically unexplainable, which makes it difficult to apply to clinical practice, leading to a relative delay in intervention and a lack of effective treatments.\nOBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop an auxiliary diagnostic model based on machine learning (ML) to predict the occurrence of FGR in patients with preeclampsia.\nMETHODS: This study used a retrospective case-control approach to analyze 38 features, including the basic medical history and peripheral blood laboratory test results of pregnant patients with preeclampsia, either complicated or not complicated by FGR. ML models were constructed to evaluate the predictive value of maternal parameter changes on preeclampsia combined with FGR. Multiple algorithms were tested, including logistic regression, light gradient boosting, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, and support vector machine. The model performance was identified by the area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation indexes. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was adopted to rank the feature importance and explain the final model for clinical application.\nRESULTS: The RF model performed best in discriminative ability among the 7 ML models. After reducing features according to importance rank, an explainable final RF model was established with 9 features, including urinary protein quantification, gestational week of delivery, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, amniotic fluid index, triglyceride, D-dimer, weight, height, and maximum systolic pressure. The model could accurately predict FGR for 513 patients with preeclampsia (149 with FGR and 364 without FGR) in the training and testing dataset (AUC 0.83, SD 0.03) using 5-fold cross-validation, which was closely validated for 103 patients with preeclampsia (n=45 with FGR and n=58 without FGR) in an external dataset (AUC 0.82, SD 0.048). On the whole, urinary protein quantification, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, and gestational week of delivery exhibited the highest contributions to the model performance (c=0.45, 0.34, and 0.33) based on SHAP analysis. For specific individual patients, SHAP results reveal the protective and risk factors to develop FGR for interpreting the model's clinical significance. Finally, the model has been translated into a convenient web page tool to facilitate its use in clinical settings.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study successfully developed a model that accurately predicts FGR development in patients with preeclampsia.

Existing diabetes apps offer features that enable integrations with various devices that streamline diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps, or regular activity trackers. While this reduces the tracking burden on the users, the research highlighted several issues with diabetes apps, including issues with reliability and trustworthiness. As pumps and continuous glucose monitors are safety-critical systems-where issues can result in serious harm or fatalities-it is important to understand what issues and vulnerabilities could be introduced by relying on popular diabetes apps as an interface for interacting with such devices.\nOBJECTIVE: As there is a lack of research examining in detail the integrations and potential suitability of apps as part of a wider self-management ecosystem, our goal was 2-fold. First, we aimed to understand the current landscape of device integrations within diabetes apps and how well they meet users' needs. Second, we identified the key issues users of the most popular apps face currently and what features are the source of these issues.\nMETHODS: Through searches in Android and iPhone app stores, we systematically identified 21 diabetes apps that offer integrations.

This study introduces a rigorous multivariate time series analysis, integrating meteorological factors with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, to predict DENV case trends across different temporal scales. Leveraging a robust data pipeline, this research incorporates a strategic downscaling technique, applying the Stochastic Bayesian Downscaling (SBD) algorithm to convert monthly DENV case data to daily frequency. This approach addresses key issues in the handling of sparse datasets and missing data, offering novel insights into the potential accuracy benefits of data downscaling in time series forecasting. Among the models assessed, the decision tree demonstrated superior performance on the actual monthly data, achieving an accuracy of 74.6 %  . In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of 95.8 %  , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a 28.5 %  improvement in accuracy and an 89.3 %  reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting.

Timely and precise detection of various stages of cervical cancer plays a crucial role in enhancing the chances of successful treatment and extending patient survival.

In our study, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Grassmann manifold (GM) learning are explored for reliable cancer detection using fluorescence spectral signals collected from 110 subjects representing various categories of the human cervix. Initially, EMD is used to decompose the signal into several multi-feature intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) on a spectral scale. Each IMF demonstrates uniqueness by capturing the inherent frequency characteristics within the signal, thus facilitating the extraction of signal features. The GM representation of IMFs is employed for investigating the non-linear subspace structure within spectral signals, which is subsequently followed by a low-rank representation to transform and analyze the spectral signals. The GM allows for the extraction of relevant information, reduction of dimensionality, and exploration of complex relationships within data, ultimately contributing to improved diagnosis. Mutual information is further used for feature selection to reduce the number of features and hence the computational cost.

Continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems have enhanced the quality of life and glycemic outcomes while reducing severe hypoglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis hospitalizations. Despite these benefits, racial inequities in the use of advanced diabetes technology (ADT) persist.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate a best practice advisory (BPA) within the electronic medical record (EMR) to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in ADT use. We hypothesize that an EMR-based BPA designed to standardize the prescribing of ADTs will minimize racial and ethnic disparities in ADT adoption or progression in use among pediatric and adult people with type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: The Best Practice Advisories to Reduce Inequities in Technology Use (BPA-TECH) study will use a nonrandomized matched pair intervention design. Phase 1 will use qualitative methods to develop and refine the BPA, including focus groups and surveys of health care providers and people with type 1 diabetes or their caregivers. Phase 2 will evaluate the effectiveness of the BPA through a controlled before-after study of people with type 1 diabetes seen at 7 T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) centers, with control people with type 1 diabetes matched from nonintervention T1DX-QI centers. The baseline and postintervention periods will be the 12 months before and 12 months after deployment of the BPA at the intervention centers, respectively. Eligibility criteria include people with type 1 diabetes aged ≥2 years with an EMR diagnosis of T1D during the baseline period. The primary outcome is the progression in ADT use from the baseline to postintervention periods.\nRESULTS: This 3-year study began in July 2024, with data collection from key stakeholders for phase 1 qualitative research beginning in August 2024. For phase 2, we estimate approximately 3000 eligible non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic people with type 1 diabetes at the intervention centers and 15,000 matched controls. Data on ADT use, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), severe hypoglycemic events, and diabetes ketoacidosis events will be collected via the T1DX-QI coordinating center. The study is powered to detect a between-group difference of 15% in the proportion of patients in the intervention and control groups in meeting the primary endpoint.

With a population of 148.88 million, India holds the world's largest goat population, comprising 41 recognized indigenous breeds. These goats provide milk, meat, and fiber, particularly in marginal environments. The genomic advancements in goat research have revolutionized the understanding of genetic diversity, adaptation, and trait improvement. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and transcriptomics have unveiled genetic markers associated with production, disease resistance, and reproductive traits. Genomic tools such as the Illumina Goat SNP50K BeadChip and high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of selection signatures and quantitative trait loci (QTL), influencing economically important traits like milk yield, meat quality, and prolificacy. Notably, genes such as DGAT1, GHR, BMPR1B, and HSP70 have been linked to production efficiency, reproductive performance, and climate resilience. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) have enabled precision breeding, enhancing genetic gains and reducing inbreeding risks. The application of RNA sequencing has provided insights into gene expression patterns governing lactation, growth, and reproductive efficiency. Epigenomic studies, focusing on DNA methylation and histone modifications, have highlighted regulatory mechanisms underpinning prolificacy and muscle development. Conservation genomics has played a pivotal role in safeguarding native breeds by assessing genetic diversity and mitigating inbreeding depression. Indicine goat breeds, such as Jamunapari, Beetal, Barbari, and Black Bengal, exhibit unique genetic adaptations to diverse agro-climatic conditions, emphasizing the need for their conservation. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, hold promise for precision breeding to enhance productivity and disease resistance.

In a recent study, our all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a nonlinearly large electroosmotic (EOS) flow (in the presence of an applied electric field) in nanochannels grafted with PMETAC [poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride] brushes. Given the lack of any formal procedure that would have directed us to identify the correct factors responsible for such an occurrence, we needed to devote several months to unraveling the involved mechanisms. In this letter, we propose a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based machine learning (ML) approach to address this gap. At first, we obtained data on certain basic features from the all-atom MD data. These basic features represent the number of atoms of a certain species around one atom of another (or the same) species. We obtain such data on basic features for a reference case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a smaller electric field) and a perturbed case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a larger electric field) in bins into which the nanochannel half height has been divided. These data sets are high-dimensional data sets to which the LDA is applied. This leads to the projection of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) in a highly separated form on a 1D line. From such LDA calculations, we can identify the relative importance of the different basic features in ensuring this separation of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) on the 1D line. The relative importance of the different basic features is quantified as \"importance scores\" for the different features, which, in turn, tell us what to study and where to study.

Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates between groups. The primary outcome was incident delirium; secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess outcomes.\nRESULTS: After matching, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of delirium compared with metformin (ARR 5.03%, 3.97% vs. 9.0%; aHR 0.91 [95% CI 0.87, 0.95], P < 0.001).

While the digitalization of health care, including telemedicine and artificial intelligence, offers sustainability benefits, it also raises concerns about energy use and electronic waste. Balancing these factors is key to a sustainable health care future.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to examine the extent to which digitalization in the health care sector influences environmental sustainability. Specifically, it aimed to assess how digitalization can contribute to reducing the health care sector's impact on global climate change. From these findings, conclusions were drawn regarding the extent to which digitalization aligns with the objectives of the Planetary Health movement and how these 2 movements may mutually reinforce each other.\nMETHODS: A scoping review guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines using databases such as PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and 58 quantitative studies from 2009 to 2024 were analyzed for environmental, social, and economic outcomes aligned with Planetary Health goals.\nRESULTS: This review analyzed 58 studies on the environmental impact of digitalization in health care primarily focusing on telemedicine, which was examined in 91% (53/58) of the studies. Most studies (56/58, 97%) quantified transport-related emissions avoided through digitalization, with some also assessing emissions from health care facilities, medical equipment, and energy consumption. Findings indicated that telemedicine significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions, with total avoided emissions amounting to approximately 830 million kg. A substantial proportion of the studies (36/58, 62%) focused on social aspects, highlighting factors such as patient satisfaction, time efficiency, and overall convenience. In addition, economic considerations were analyzed in 48% (28/58) of the studies, emphasizing cost reductions and resource optimization. However, only 12% (7/58) of the studies evaluated the full life cycle impact of digital technologies, highlighting the need for further research on their long-term environmental sustainability.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review calls for further research beyond telemedicine, advocating for life cycle analyses and actionable strategies for a sustainable digitalization in health care systems.

Furthermore, our functional assays revealed that OVOL1 enhances the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Although ossification in tendon tissue has been reported in a range of aging and disease models, the underlying biomarkers and mechanisms remain unknown. And the characterisation and sensitivity of previous diagnostic biomarkers for tendon ectopic ossification do not meet the demands of clinical use. The aim of this study was to characterise the effects of aging on ossification in the mouse Achilles tendon and to identify characteristic genes and therapeutic targets for tendon ossification in mice by using a machine learning approach.\nMETHODS: We retrieved the transcriptome profile of GSE126118 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Following background correction and normalization using the transcripts per million (TPM) method, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the limma R package (p < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1). Subsequently, 468 senescence genes were downloaded from the Aging Atlas database, and senescence-associated DEGs (HO senescence genes) were identified. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted on the identified DEGs. To further refine the HO aging signature, support vector machine (SVM) regression was employed. Additionally, we predicted transcription factors, miRNAs, and small molecule drugs potentially associated with the characterized genes.\nRESULTS: Three characterised genes were identified as biomarkers associated with ectopic ossification and aging in the mouse Achilles tendon, Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment in processes related to cartilage endochondral ossification, metalloendopeptidase activity, and mitochondrial proton transport ATP synthase complex. Additionally, HIF-1 and GnRH signaling pathways were prominently represented among the differentially expressed genes.\nCONCLUSION: Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13 were identified as relevant signature genes for the effects of aging on Achilles tendon ossification in mice. Atp5o, Mmp2, and Mmp13 may influence tendon ossification by affecting mitochondrial function as well as extracellular matrix degradation to regulate senescence.

Despite this, access to care is still poor. This study aimed to assess barriers/facilitators to access NCDs services for children, adolescents and young people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in Mozambique.\nMETHODS: A qualitative cross-sectional study using focus groups (FG) and key-informant interviews was conducted between September and October 2023, involving patients (16-30 years), caregivers of child and adolescent patients and health care staff of 5 health facilities. A deductive approach was adopted using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework to classify themes referring to barriers/facilitators to access. Two researchers carried out quantitative content analysis independently, assessing the inter-rater agreement through Cohen's K.\nRESULTS: Four FGs were conducted with 26 patients (61.5% female, 16-24 years), three with 18 caregivers (83.3% female) and 16 interviews with healthcare workers. A total of 455 themes were identified, with a predominance of barriers (67.3%) compared to facilitators (32.7%) in accessing T1DM services. The area ''Capability'' was labelled significantly more often as a barrier (89.5%) than ''Motivation'' and ''Opportunities'' (60.2% and 62.6%, p < 0.001). The most frequent barriers were related to the psychological ability to accept and manage the disease in the absence of professional psychological support, inadequate interactions with healthcare personnel, long waits in the outpatient clinic and stigma towards diabetes in the community. Social support from family and friends appears to be an important facilitator.

TGFβ is a promising target due to its significant involvement in the desmoplasia, immune suppression, and chemoresistance characteristic of pancreatic cancer. Over 300 clinical trials targeting TGFβ have been conducted in unselected patient cohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval. Nevertheless, TGFβ blockade may hold promise for a subset of cancers with non-functional TGFβ signaling. Greater than 25% of pancreatic cancers carry mutations in SMAD4, a key component of canonical TGFβ signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify tumors susceptible to TGFβ inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human pancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse disease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed heterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited reduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and protein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, treating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGFβ antibody reduced tumor weight and improved survival.

The robustness of the MFM-clustering algorithm was validated, offering enhanced pollutant classification accuracy compared to conventional statistical methods by focusing on pollutant-specific features. We used a systematic framework comprising field investigations, target screening, risk assessment, and MFM-clustering-based source analysis. The methodology was applied to the Bohai Sea, China, as a case study, where 29 OPEs, including 15 eOPEs, were quantified in sediment samples. This application refined the clustering analysis and enabled detailed ecological risk assessments. Industries associated with OPEs production, sewage treatment plants, industrial discharges, surface runoff from automotive activities, atmospheric transport of volatile OPEs, and petroleum-related operations for most eOPEs have been identified as key contributors to OPE pollution in various regions of the Bohai Sea.

However, accurately grading IBC presents a significant challenge due to its heterogeneous nature and the need to harness the complementary information from multiple nuclei sources in histopathology images. To tackle this critical problem, we introduce a novel multi-source hybrid feature fusion network named MSFusion. This network incorporates two types of hybrid features: deep learning features extracted by a novel Swin Transformer-based multi-branch network called MSwinT, and traditional handcrafted features that capture the morphological characteristics of multi-source nuclei. The primary branch of MSwinT captures the overall characteristics of the original images, while multiple auxiliary branches focus on identifying morphological features from diverse sources of nuclei, including tumor, mitotic, tubular, and epithelial nuclei. At each of the four stages for the branches in MSwinT, a functional KDC (key diagnostic components) fusion block with channel and spatial attentions is proposed to integrate the features extracted by all the branches. Ultimately, we synthesize the multi-source hybrid deep learning features and handcrafted features to improve the accuracy of IBC diagnosis and grading. Our multi-branch MSFusion network is rigorously evaluated on three distinct datasets, including two private clinical datasets (Qilu dataset and QDUH&SHSU dataset) as well as a publicly available Databiox dataset.

It is widely utilized for examining various organs, such as the breast, thyroid, ovary, cardiac, and more. However, the manual interpretation and annotation of ultrasound images are time-consuming and prone to variability among physicians. While single-task artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored, they are not ideal for scaling AI applications in medical imaging. Foundation models, although a trending solution, often struggle with real-world medical datasets due to factors such as noise, variability, and the incapability of flexibly aligning prior knowledge with task adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose an orchestration learning framework named PerceptGuide for general-purpose ultrasound classification and segmentation. Our framework incorporates a novel orchestration mechanism based on prompted hyper-perception, which adapts to the diverse inductive biases required by different ultrasound datasets. Unlike self-supervised pre-trained models, which require extensive fine-tuning, our approach leverages supervised pre-training to directly capture task-relevant features, providing a stronger foundation for multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound imaging. To support this research, we compiled a large-scale Multi-task, Multi-organ public ultrasound dataset (M2-US), featuring images from 9 organs and 16 datasets, encompassing both classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach employs four specific prompts-Object, Task, Input, and Position-to guide the model, ensuring task-specific adaptability. Additionally, a downstream synchronization training stage is introduced to fine-tune the model for new data, significantly improving generalization capabilities and enabling real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our framework in handling multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound image processing, outperforming both specialist models and existing general AI solutions.

Currently, DCIS that might progress to IBC cannot reliably be identified. Therefore, most patients with DCIS undergo treatment resembling IBC. To facilitate identification of low-risk DCIS, we developed deep learning models using histology whole-slide images (WSIs) and clinico-pathological data.\nMETHODS: We predicted invasive recurrence in patients with primary, pure DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery using clinical Cox proportional hazards models and deep learning. Deep learning models were trained end-to-end with only WSIs or in combination with clinical data (integrative). We employed nested k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) on a Dutch multicentre dataset (n = 558). Models were also tested on the UK-based Sloane dataset (n = 94).\nFINDINGS: Evaluated over 20 years on the Dutch dataset, deep learning models using only WSIs effectively stratified patients into low-risk (no recurrence) and high-risk (invasive recurrence) groups (negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.83); hazard ratio (HR) = 4.48 (95% CI: 3.41-5.88, p < 0.0001); area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79)).

Furthermore, external validation of the models was unsuccessful, limited by the small size and low number of cases (22/94) in our external dataset, WSI quality, as well as the lack of well-annotated datasets that allow robust validation.\nINTERPRETATION: Deep learning models using routinely processed WSIs hold promise for DCIS risk stratification, while the benefits of integrating clinical data merit further investigation.

An important step involved in brachytherapy is the delineation of organs at risk (OARs) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Automating OARs segmentation in brachytherapy has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of radiation therapy planning. This paper introduces a novel segmentation model named MFFUNet for the automatic contour delineation of OARs in cervical cancer brachytherapy. The proposed model employs a staged encoder-decoder structure, integrating the self-attention mechanism of Transformer with the CNN framework. A novel multi-features fusion (MFF) block with a cross-attention-guided feature fusion mechanism is also proposed, which efficiently extracts and cross-fuses features from multiple receptive fields, enriching the semantic information of the features and thus improving the performance of complex segmentation tasks. A private CT image dataset of 95 patients with cervical cancer undergoing brachytherapy is used to evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed method. The OARs in the data consist of the bladder, rectum, and colon surrounding the cervix. The proposed model surpasses current mainstream OARs segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy. The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of all three OARs has achieved 73.69%. Among them, the DSC score for the bladder is 92.65%, for the rectum is 66.55%, and for the colon is 61.86%. Moreover, we also conducted experiments on two common public thoracoabdominal multi-organ CT datasets.

Using flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assays, we demonstrated a significant decrease in cytotoxicity and activation of NK92 cells against BCa upon CD56 deletion. Further, migration assays and atomic force microscopy showed CD56 deletion impaired NK92 cell migration and adhesion to bladder tumor cells, reducing NK92 cell-mediated apoptosis of BCa cells. Prolonged exposure to bladder tumors led to CD56 loss in NK92 cells, suggesting tumor-induced NK92 cell dysfunction via CD56 reduction, consistent with our previous findings. Confocal microscopy revealed an overlap of CD56 and phosphorylated Pyk2, a critical kinase at the tumor-immune synapse, potentially mediating the downstream cytotoxicity effects. Blocking Pyk2 phosphorylation decreased CD56-mediated NK92 cell activation and reduced NK92 cell-mediated cytotoxicity against BCa.

Recent studies highlight its unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms, showing that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can activate both the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This leads to a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviation of inflammation. Such neuroimmune regulation provides valuable insights for managing chronic inflammatory diseases, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pneumonia, and Crohn's disease. This review summarizes the functional roles of the vagus nerve in inflammatory diseases and the underlying mechanisms. It discusses how the vagus nerve regulates neural, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders through neurotransmitters, receptors, and anti-inflammatory pathways. Specifically, VNS has been shown to reduce inflammation by releasing acetylcholine, which binds to α7nAChR on immune cells and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both clinical and preclinical studies emphasize the effectiveness of non-invasive VNS in treating conditions such as stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further supporting the vagus nerve's potential as a therapeutic target. This paper also emphasizes the need for future research to better understand the specific mechanisms by which the vagus nerve modulates immune responses. Furthermore, validating the safety and efficacy of VNS through multi-center clinical trials is essential, alongside exploring personalised therapies using advanced biotechnology for precise modulation.

However, its yield is often affected by various leaf diseases. Early identification of maize leaf disease through easily accessible tool is required to increase the yield of maize. Recently, researchers have attempted to detect and classify maize leaf diseases using Deep Learning algorithms. However, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, nearly all the studies are concentrated on developing an offline model that can detect maize diseases. But, those models are not easily accessible to individuals and don't provide immediate feedback and monitoring. Thus, in this study, we developed a novel real-time, user-friendly maize leaf disease detection and classification mobile application. The VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50 models were implemented and compared their performance on maize disease detection and classification. A total of 4188 images of blight, common_rust, grey_leaf_spot, and healthy were used to train each model. Data augmentation techniques were applied to the dataset to increase the size of the dataset, which can also reduce model overfitting. Weighted cross-entropy loss was also employed to mitigate class-imbalance problems. After training, VGG16 achieved 95% of testing accuracy, AlexNet achieved 91%, and ResNet50 achieved 72% of testing accuracy. The VGG16 model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.

However, factors influencing bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in Chinese individuals with T2D remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biochemical determinants of BMD and TBS in patients with T2D, with a focus on elucidating the role of weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) in modulating bone mass and quality in this cohort.\nMETHODS: Data of 161 women and 153 men with T2D collected between July 2022 and March 2023 in Shenzhen, China, were analyzed in our cross-sectional study. Lumbar spine BMD and TBS of all participants were obtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. WWI was defined as waist circumference over the square root of weight.\nRESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that lumbar spine TBS was inversely correlated with age, menopausal status, and WWI in women (p < 0.05). In men, TBS was negatively associated with age and WWI (p < 0.05). For women, glycated hemoglobin A1c positively influenced BMD (p < 0.05), whereas age, diabetic retinopathy, and N-mid osteocalcin were negatively associated. No significant predictors of BMD were identified in the male cohort. For predicting degraded TBS, the optimal WWI cut-offs were 11.257 cm/√kg (S: 61.1%, E: 80.7%) in males and 11.247 cm/√kg (S: 70.3%, E: 71.1%) in females.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight WWI as a novel and potentially more precise indicator of body fat, associated with diminished bone quality rather than solely low bone mass in patients with T2D in China.

Leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator for assessing the growth condition and yield potential of rice, and the traditional methods for obtaining LAI have problems such as low efficiency and large error. With the development of remote sensing technology, unmanned aerial multispectral remote sensing combined with deep learning technology provides a new way for efficient and accurate estimation of LAI in rice.\nRESULTS: In this study, a multispectral camera mounted on a UAV was utilized to acquire rice canopy image data, and rice LAI was uniformly estimated over multiple periods by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models in deep learning. The results showed that the CNN model based on five-band reflectance images (490, 550, 670, 720, and 850 nm) as input after feature screening exhibited high estimation accuracy at different growth stages.

Further, the aim is to assess the potential efficacy of the intervention in reducing maternal and neonatal health complications compared with standard care.\nMETHODS: VALID-II is a two-site, two-arm, non-randomised feasibility intervention study in Thai Binh Province in northern Vietnam with a delayed start for the intervention group. The intervention study is nested in a larger cohort. In total, 2000 pregnant women will be screened for GDM, with an estimated 400 women screening positive according to the World Health Organisation-International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group diagnostic criteria. First, 200 women who screen positive for GDM will be assigned to a control group that will receive standard care. Among the 200 women, 20 will take part in an in-depth ethnographic study along with their family members, and the intervention will be co-created with them. Second, once the intervention has been created, 200 women will be assigned to the intervention group, which will receive the intervention plus standard care. Twenty women and their families from the intervention group will also take part in an ethnographic study.

A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).\nRESULTS: The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate.

Currently, selection of brachytherapy applicators relies on physician's clinical experience, which can lead to variability in treatment quality and outcomes. This study presents a deep learning-based decision-support tool for selecting between interstitial Syed applicators and intracavitary tandem & ovoids applicators.\nAPPROACH: The network architecture consists of six 3D convolutional-pooling-ReLU blocks, followed by a fully connected block. The input to the network includes three channels: a 3D contour mask of clinical target volume (CTV), organs at risk (OAR), and central tandem, and two 3D distance maps of CTV and OAR voxels relative to the tandem's central axis. The network outputs a probability score, indicating the suitability of Syed applicators. Binary cross-entropy loss combined with L1 regularization was used for network training.\nMAIN RESULTS: A retrospective study was performed on 184 LACC patients with 422 instances of applicator insertion. The data was divided into three sets: Dataset-1 of 163 patients with 372 insertions for training and hyperparameter tuning, Dataset-2 of 17 patients with 36 insertions and Dataset-3 of four complex cases with 14 insertions for testing.

However, differences in demographics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes across colon cancer stages and locations between these databases remain incompletely understood. Addressing these disparities is crucial for researchers when selecting the most appropriate registry for survival analysis.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically compare patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates between NCDB and SEER across various tumor locations and disease stages in colon cancer.\nMETHODS: We analyzed patients undergoing surgery for Stages I-IV primary colon cancer (2004-2019), comparing patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates across distinct tumor locations and cancer stages in NCDB and SEER. Our objective was to assess how differences in database structure and sampling methodologies influence reported survival outcomes.\nRESULTS: The study included 777 827 patients (NCDB: 572 196; SEER: 205 631). Proximal colon cancers were more common in older and female patients in both databases, whereas distal colon cancers were more prevalent in younger patients. NCDB contained a slightly higher proportion of Caucasian patients, while SEER had a greater representation of Asian patients. Segmental resections were more frequent in SEER, with the highest weighted difference observed in sigmoid colon cancer (6.16%; 95% CI: 5.78%-6.54%). OS rates were generally comparable across databases, though minor variations were observed at different colonic locations and stages.\nCONCLUSION: Despite differences in sampling techniques and follow-up reporting, NCDB and SEER demonstrated remarkable consistency in survival trends across colon cancer stages and locations. Recognizing these database-specific variations is essential for researchers conducting population-based survival analyses and selecting the most suitable registry for their studies. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE?: This study provides a comprehensive comparison of NCDB and SEER, highlighting how differences in sampling methodologies, follow-up reporting, and patient representation influence overall survival estimates in colon cancer.

In conclusion, our study established the therapeutic potential of dual PIM/HDAC inhibitors and provided a tool to elucidate synergistic mechanisms underlying the combined inhibition of these targets.", "authors": ["Xin Yabing", "Xiao Can", "Wang Nan", "Wu Huidan", "Kang Wenjing", "Chen Xuetao", "Liu Chihong", "You Qidong", "Jiang Zhengyu", "Guo Xiaoke"], "published_date": "2025-05-30", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "新型喹唑啉酮-吡咯二氫吡咯酮類似物的合理設計：作為PIM/HDAC雙重靶點抑制劑用於治療急性骨髓性白血病", "summary_zh": "急性骨髓性白血病(AML)患者對單一標靶藥物治療的反應往往不佳。同時針對多個致癌途徑是一種有前景的癌症治療策略。本研究基於PIM抑制劑C28和HDAC抑制劑SAHA在MV4-11細胞中表現出的協同抗增殖能力，開發了一系列新型雙重PIM/HDAC抑制劑。其中，化合物22在MV4-11細胞中表現出強大的抗增殖活性，以及對PIM1和HDAC6的強效抑制作用。流式細胞術分析表明，22以劑量依賴性方式誘導MV4-11細胞凋亡。機制上，用22處理顯著誘導PARP的切割，從而啟動細胞凋亡。此外，22在MV4-11異種移植模型中表現出顯著的抗癌功效（TGI = 81.3%；50 mg/kg，QD），且無明顯毒性。總之，我們的研究確立了雙重PIM/HDAC抑制劑的治療潛力，並提供了一種工具來闡明這些靶點聯合抑制的協同機制。", "applications": ["想像一下，我們現在找到了一種新的藥物，它就像一把雙面刃，可以同時攻擊癌細胞的兩個弱點。對於那些對傳統治療反應不好的血癌病人來說，這可能是一個新的希望，讓他們有機會戰勝疾病。", "這項研究就像是為醫生們提供了一種新的武器。以前我們只有單一的子彈，現在有了可以同時發射兩顆子彈的槍。這有助於我們更有效地控制癌細胞的生長，防止它們擴散。", "這項研究的另一個重要意義是，它幫助我們更了解癌細胞的工作方式。通過同時抑制癌細胞的兩個關鍵功能，我們可以更好地理解這些功能是如何協同作用，導致癌症發生的。這為我們開發更有效的治療方法打開了新的大門。"], "audio": "audios/40444519.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-30T18:23:26.631967"}
{"query": "diabetes management", "id": "40444435", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40444435/", "title": "Psyllium-enriched mashed potatoes: impact of texture, rheology, and oral processing on starch digestion.", "summary": "BACKGROUND: Psyllium, a dietary fiber known to improve glycemic control, holds potential for incorporation into potato dishes to lower their glycemic index. However, it is not clearly established how addition of psyllium impacts properties of potato products and starch digestibility. Starch digestion initiates during oral processing, critically affecting its bioavailability. This study aimed to evaluate how psyllium-induced changes in rheological properties, chewing duration, and bolus characteristics alter starch digestibility during habitual mastication in mashed potatoes (MP).\nRESULTS: The incorporation of psyllium into an MP sample containing κ-carrageenan led to significant improvements in mechanical properties, including a 20% increase in hardness and a 15% increase in cohesiveness. Enhanced gel strength was further corroborated by elevated storage (G') and complex (G*) moduli values. These modifications necessitated prolonged chewing to achieve a swallowable bolus. Notably, the psyllium-containing bolus exhibited greater hardness and reduced fragmentation immediately prior to swallowing. Despite its enhanced rigidity, the MP-carrageenan- psyllium bolus was ingested without difficulty, likely attributable to psyllium's cohesiveness-enhancing effects. This combination of increased cohesiveness and diminished fragmentation contributed to a beneficial 20% reduction in starch digestion during mastication of psyllium-enriched MP samples.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that psyllium incorporation into MP can beneficially modulate its textural properties and bolus characteristics, resulting in reduced starch digestion. This finding offers new opportunities for designing functional foods based on traditionally consumed starchy foods, which could be particularly beneficial for managing glycemic levels in diabetic populations. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.", "authors": ["Khramova Daria S", "Vityazev Fedor V", "Zueva Natalya V", "Chistiakova Elizaveta A"], "published_date": "2025-05-30", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "洋車前子強化馬鈴薯泥：質地、流變學和口腔處理對澱粉消化的影響", "summary_zh": "本研究探討在馬鈴薯泥中添加洋車前子（一種膳食纖維）如何影響澱粉消化。研究發現，添加洋車前子能改善馬鈴薯泥的質地，使其更具硬度和黏性，同時延長咀嚼時間。儘管如此，添加洋車前子的馬鈴薯泥更容易吞嚥，且在吞嚥前，食物團塊的硬度更高，碎片化程度更低。最重要的是，與未添加洋車前子的馬鈴薯泥相比，添加洋車前子的馬鈴薯泥在咀嚼過程中澱粉消化減少了20%。這表示洋車前子有助於降低馬鈴薯泥的澱粉消化速度。這項研究為開發有益血糖控制的機能性澱粉食品提供了新的方向，特別是對糖尿病患者的血糖管理有潛在益處。", "applications": ["1. 血糖控制：對於需要控制血糖的人，比如糖尿病患者，可以在日常飲食中加入這種改良過的馬鈴薯泥，幫助他們更穩定地控制餐後血糖。", "2. 健康飲食：對於注重健康的人，可以選擇這種添加洋車前子的馬鈴薯泥，因為它能減緩澱粉的消化速度，讓人更有飽足感，有助於體重管理。", "3. 食品創新：食品公司可以利用這項研究，開發更多適合糖尿病患者或注重健康人群的機能性澱粉類食品，例如改良版的米飯、麵條等。"], "audio": "audios/40444435.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-30T18:23:45.855797"}
