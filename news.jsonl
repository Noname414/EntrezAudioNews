Identifying refracture risk is crucial for implementing effective preventive strategies. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of refracture following an initial vertebral fragility fracture.\nMETHODS: The study included both men and women, focusing on individuals aged 60 and above. The fractures were diagnosed using X-rays. Participants from three centers were used for model development, while the fourth center was used for validation. The discrimination and calibration of each model was assessed using the validation set. A predictive model for preoperative refracture risk was developed using logistic regression analysis and visualized via a nomogram.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,632 participants with a median age of 72 years were enrolled, of whom 428 had experienced a refracture. Eleven factors were identified as significant predictors of refracture: age, rehabilitation status, treatment regimen, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), duration of medication use, history of comorbidities, fall risk, and levels of bone gla protein (BGP), total alkaline phosphatase (TALP), and homocysteine (Hcy).

This study combines cross-sectional and meta-analytic methods to comprehensively explore the relationship between DN and osteoporosis in T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study included 523 T2DM patients, classified into DN and non-DN groups. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and multivariate analysis identified osteoporosis-related factors. The meta-analysis included studies published from 1999 to 2021, comparing BMD between patients with and without DN. The results showed that while significant differences in clinical characteristics and biochemical indices (such as age, HbA1c, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels) were observed between the groups, no significant association between DN and osteoporosis was found after adjusting for covariates like body mass index and blood pressure. Additionally, the meta-analysis confirmed no significant impact of DN on BMD across skeletal sites, including the lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck.

However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.\nOBJECTIVES: This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.\nMETHODS: We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.\nRESULTS: A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption.

Web-based interventions (WBIs) can be used to achieve this goal.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the treatment needs of young people with GD in Germany and derive implications for the development of a self-guided WBI for GD.\nMETHODS: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted a focus group with 3 young male adults and semistructured individual interviews with 3 male adolescents. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The reporting of this study followed the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines.\nRESULTS: Participants' expectations of web-based help in general and of a self-guided WBI for GD revealed a wide variety of sometimes conflicting user needs. For example, by analyzing participants' experiences with successful strategies, we found that external stabilizers (eg, parental control and support group meetings) were helpful in managing GD. However, with regard to a WBI, participants described it as a barrier if the WBI created \"too much pressure.\" On the other hand, \"not enough pressure\" (ie, not enough external control) was also mentioned as a barrier. The belief that gaming is rewarding and that only equally rewarding activities are successful alternatives to gaming is in tension with the fact that changing problematic gaming behavior can be stressful and not feel rewarding at all. The data also showed that, on the one hand, a WBI should be designed to be attractive (eg, by incorporating gaming elements) but that it should not be too attractive as this, in turn, could trigger GD.\nCONCLUSIONS: A self-guided WBI for GD should consider and address conflicting user needs. Ambivalence of needs in the face of coping with GD should not be seen as a problem but as a normal part of a change process and, therefore, actively integrated into the WBI concept and storyline.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00032334; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00032334.", "authors": ["Geisler Birte Linny", "Petersen Kay Uwe", "Hanke Sara", "Schurer Simon", "Schreiber Anne", "Lämmle Christine", "Batra Anil", "Renner Tobias", "Brandhorst Isabel"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "矛盾的使用者需求：設計網路成癮網路介入措施的挑戰與機遇——青少年與年輕成人之質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "本研究探討德國網路遊戲成癮青少年和年輕人對網路介入治療的需求。研究發現，使用者對於網路介入抱持著複雜且矛盾的期望。例如，他們需要外部支持（如家長控制和支持團體），但同時又排斥過度的壓力。他們認為遊戲本身具有吸引力，但網路介入又不能過於吸引人，以免反過來觸發成癮行為。研究結論指出，設計網路遊戲成癮的網路介入措施時，應考慮並處理這些矛盾的需求。將這些矛盾視為改變過程中的正常現象，並將其納入網路介入的設計和故事主線中，才能更有效地幫助使用者。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果你的孩子沉迷遊戲，這個研究可以幫助你設計一個既能引導孩子，又不會讓他們反感的網路戒癮計畫，就像一個溫柔的導師，而不是嚴厲的監管者。", "很多年輕人想戒掉遊戲癮，但又覺得很難。這個研究就像一份客製化的地圖，告訴設計師如何打造一個既有趣又能幫助他們擺脫遊戲的網路工具，讓戒癮不再是痛苦的掙扎，而是一場有趣的冒險。", "對於開發網路戒癮App的公司來說，這項研究提供寶貴的洞察，讓他們知道如何設計出真正符合使用者需求的產品，避免一味地強制控制，而是創造一個更人性化、更有效的解決方案。"], "audio": "audios/40418804.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:40:59.790015"}

As medical knowledge expands, clinicians are increasingly using evidence-based point-of-care information (POCI) resources to facilitate clinical decision-making in medical practices. While these tools can improve clinical outcomes, few studies have assessed clinicians' opinions on integrating them with EHRs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess clinicians' attitudes and the perceived value of POCI resources for finding medication- and disease-related information in clinical practice and their integration with EHRs.\nMETHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 clinicians from various roles and specialties between December 2021 and January 2022 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. A content analysis approach was used to examine participants' responses and feedback on their current use of POCI resources, barriers and facilitators, mobile app use, and recommendations for improved integration.\nRESULTS: Of the 10 participants, 6 (60%) were female, 9 (90%) were aged <40 years, and 8 (80%) had ≤10 years of experience in clinical practice. While UpToDate was the most preferred disease-related information resource (n=9, 90%), preferences for medication-related resources varied, with 2 (20%) participants favoring Micromedex, 2 (20%) favoring Lexicomp, 2 (20%) favoring Brigham and Women's Hospital-specific drug administration guidelines, 2 (20%) favoring UpToDate, and 1 (10%) favoring Medscape. Most participants used their preferred tools weekly. Most clinicians preferred comprehensive POCI tools with clear, navigable layouts that eased and quickened the search for information. Features such as heavy text density, the lack of citations, and frequent log-ins to access the tool were viewed as barriers that limited content legibility, credibility, and accessibility. Access-related, tool-specific, and integration-related barriers were reported to negatively impact clinical workflow. Most (n=8, 80%) of the participants reported currently using mobile apps, reasoning that they facilitated quick and convenient searches for information; however, frequent updates, time-consuming log-ins, and high text density on smaller screens posed challenges. Most participants favored further integration of POCI resources with EHRs, with all reporting them being currently available as embedded links that launch externally. Some recommended that further integration would allow us to leverage existing POCI tool features, such as chatbots and knowledge links, as well as aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as predictive algorithms and personalized alert systems, to enhance EHR functionality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants favored integration to improve usability and optimize workplace efficiency by reducing the amount of time spent seeking answers to their medication- and disease-related questions. Recommendations on integration highlighted the need for stakeholder input in developing clinical decision support tools and interfaces that leverage advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning while not compromising user experience or increasing time spent on tasks.", "authors": ["Marceau Marlika", "Dulgarian Sevan", "Cambre Jacob", "Garabedian Pamela M", "Amato Mary G", "Seger Diane L", "Volk Lynn A", "Jackson Gretchen Purcell", "Bates David W", "Rozenblum Ronen", "Syrowatka Ania"], "published_date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "臨床醫師對於照護點資訊資源的態度和認知及其與電子健康紀錄整合：一項質性訪談研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究探討了臨床醫師對於在臨床實務中使用照護點資訊資源（POCI）的看法，以及將這些資源整合到電子健康紀錄（EHR）中的價值。研究團隊在波士頓Brigham and Women's Hospital訪談了10位不同職位和專科的臨床醫師。研究發現，UpToDate是最受歡迎的疾病資訊資源，而藥物資訊資源的選擇則較為分散。醫師們偏好內容全面、排版清晰的POCI工具，但認為文字過於密集、缺乏引用以及頻繁登入等問題會影響使用體驗。多數醫師使用手機App來快速搜尋資訊，但也面臨更新頻繁、登入耗時等挑戰。大家普遍支持將POCI資源與EHR進一步整合，以提升可用性、減少尋找資訊的時間，並建議利用人工智慧和機器學習技術來強化EHR的功能。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果醫生在看診時，需要的藥物資訊或疾病知識，不用再花時間翻書或上網查，而是直接在電腦系統裡就能快速找到，就像有個隨身醫療百科全書一樣，這就能幫助醫生更有效率地做出正確的診斷和治療。", "如果你今天去看醫生，醫生可以透過整合的系統，快速了解最新的治療方法和藥物資訊，這表示你接受到的醫療照護是與時俱進的，不會因為醫生太忙或資訊落後而延誤病情。", "醫院可以利用這個研究結果，設計出更好用的電子病歷系統，讓醫生更容易找到需要的資訊，減少錯誤發生的機率，最終提升整體醫療品質，讓病人得到更好的照顧。"], "audio": "audios/40418791.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T03:41:10.349412"}

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-efficiency of bDMARD dose reduction in patients with AS and apply machine learning to identify key factors influencing disease control.\nMETHODS: This 12-month prospective study, 368 AS patients receiving ≥ 3 months of full-dose bDMARDs were included. Among 215 initial responders (ASDAS < 2.1), 146 underwent dose reduction while 69 continued full-dose therapy. Clinical outcomes such as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) and ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) were assessed, along with cost effectiveness using incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER). Random forest models were developed to predict the achievement of inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) and to identify key predictors.\nRESULTS: The dose reduction group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in CRP (-4.05 vs. +2.83 mg/L, p < 0.001), BASDAI (-3.00 vs. +0.89, p < 0.001), and ASDAS (-1.42 vs. +0.09, p < 0.001) compared to the full dose group.

Previous studies have described disruption of the norms of academic publishing during this time. This study uses an epidemiological statistical toolkit alongside machine-learning methods to investigate the functioning of the scientific information-generation and -consumption ecosystem throughout the pandemic.\nMETHODS: A dataset of 17 million scientific research papers that were published between January 2019 and December 2022 was analysed. Data on citations and Altmetrics were harvested, and topic modelling was applied to abstracts. COVID-19-related articles were identified from title text. We investigated publication dynamics, correlations between citation metrics and Altmetrics, rates of publication in preprints, and temporal trends in topics, and compared these metrics in COVID-19 papers vs non-COVID-19 papers.\nRESULTS: Throughout 2020-2, 3.7% of English-language research output was on the topic of COVID-19. Journal articles on COVID-19 were published at a consistent rate during this period, while preprints peaked in early 2020 and decreased thereafter. COVID-19 preprints had lower publication rates in the peer-reviewed literature than other preprints, particularly those that were preprinted during early 2020. COVID-19 research received significantly more media and social media attention than non-COVID-19 research, and preprints received more attention, on average, than journal articles, with attention peaking during the initial wave and subsequent peaks corresponding to the emergence of novel variants. COVID-19 articles exhibited a higher correlation between Altmetrics and citation metrics compared with non-COVID-19 publications, suggesting a strong alignment between scientific and public attention.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of the rapid expansion of COVID-19 research, revealing evolving research areas and waxing and waning public interest across different topics.

Nevertheless, conventional epilepsy seizure detection approaches face difficulties such as poor epilepsy seizure detection accuracy and higher computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a novel TransseizNet framework for epilepsy seizure detection from the electroencephalography signal.\nMETHODS: The electroencephalography data from three datasets are pre-processed using the Savitzky-Golay filter. The proposed framework utilizes the Empirical Tunable Q-Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition, which is the combination of the Empirical Wavelet Transform and the Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform. This enhances time-frequency resolution and adaptively captures localized oscillatory patterns critical for precise seizure detection. The proposed framework utilizes a Wavelet-Graph Convolutional Network Vision Transformer for epilepsy seizure detection and classification. The integration of wavelet-driven attention with graph-based learning enhances spatial-temporal feature representation, which makes seizure detection more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient than the baseline approaches.\nRESULTS: The TransseizNet model is trained and validated on three datasets and achieves an average accuracy of 98.65% a precision of 98.59%, a F1-score of 98.45%, a recall of 98.30%, a specificity of 98.52%, a computational time of 17 sec, and the detection latency of 2.5 sec, which outperforms the performance of baseline approaches in the detection of epileptic seizures.\nDISCUSSION: TransseizNet framework provides superior performance in seizure detection by efficiently integrating adaptive frequency decomposition and hybrid deep learning.

However, cancer researchers still face a significant challenge in accurately predicting breast cancer patients' survival rates. The purpose was to predict breast cancer survival using a Bayesian network.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 2,995 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently hospitalized between January 1, 2012, and December 30, 2024. SPSS Modeler version 18.0 was used to build prediction models. The data were randomly split into a training set (2,097 cases, 70%) and a test set (898 cases, 30%) for developing the Bayesian network model and predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The model included demographic variables (age, marital status, and governorate), laboratory/clinical variables (hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, presence of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) and the outcome variable, patient survival status (binary value: survived/died). The discriminative ability of models was evaluated by accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) in terms of superior predictive performance for breast cancer outcomes.\nRESULTS: The Bayesian model exhibited the best discriminatory performance among the nine models, with an AUC of 0.859 and the highest accuracy of 96.661%. In the context of feature importance, white blood cell value at the time of diagnosis was the most important feature for predicting the survival of breast cancer. Patients who had below-normal hemoglobin and above-normal white blood count values had a higher death probability than patients who had normal white blood count and hemoglobin values. The presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with breast cancer led to a reduced survival probability.\nCONCLUSION: The Bayesian model outperformed the other models in predicting the survival probability of breast cancer.

However, prenatal screening is prone to inaccuracies, leading to potentially unnecessary interventions. This study aims to evaluate the factors influencing the accuracy of third-trimester screening for LGA fetuses to improving diagnostic accuracy.\nMETHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted involving low-risk pregnancies from three hospitals. Screening was analyzed using ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC) and symphysial fundal height (SFH) measurements. EFW and AC were assessed either during the routine third-trimester ultrasound or during an additional growth ultrasound when available. Newborns were classified as LGA based on AUDIPOG growth curves. Screening performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), Youden's index and accuracy. We also evaluated composite screening tests combining biometric parameters with maternal clinical risk factors and influence of gestational age at the time of growth ultrasound to identify the optimal timing for screening.\nRESULTS: Among 2,217 women, risk factors such as high BMI and gestational diabetes increased suspicion of LGA fetuses, contributing to both true and false positive results (p<0.001). No single ultrasound parameter demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. Third-trimester ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 37 % [31-44 %] and a specificity of 94 % [93-95 %], while growth ultrasound improved sensitivity to 65 % [57-74 %] but reduced specificity to 82 % [79-85 %]. SFH measurements did not enhance screening performance. Overestimation of fetal weight was observed in 56.89 % (95/167) of cases, with errors exceeding 10 % in 26.95 % (122/167) of newborns. Combined screening using fetal biometry and maternal clinical risk factors showed high specificity but poor sensitivity, limiting their utility as standalone tools for detecting macrosomia.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the impact of operator bias in LGA screening, with risk factors influencing measurements. The modest performance of ultrasound-based screening highlights the inherent limitations of current methods.

Among them, the control group used videos for skill acquisition, and the ChatGPT group used ChatGPT in addition to the videos. After 1 week of intervention, skills were tested using desktop virtual reality, and cognitive load was measured by recording changes in pupil diameter with an eye tracker. In addition, a spatial ability test was administered to analyze the effect of ChatGPT on those with different spatial abilities. Finally, a questionnaire was also used to assess cognitive load and self-efficacy during the learning process.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 dental undergraduates from a top-tier Chinese university were initially recruited for the experiment by October 25, 2024.

While deep learning techniques improve the accuracy of segmentation, traditional voxel-based segmentation and surface reconstruction pipelines tend to introduce artifacts such as disconnected regions, topological inconsistencies, and stepped distortions. To overcome these challenges, we propose ToPoMesh, an end-to-end 3D mesh reconstruction deep learning framework for direct reconstruction of high-fidelity surface meshes from CT volume data. To address the existing problems, our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) accurate local and global shape modeling by preserving and enhancing local feature information through residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks; (2) an adaptive variant density (Avd) mesh de-pooling strategy, which dynamically optimizes the vertex distribution; (3) a topology modification module that iteratively prunes the error surfaces and boundary smoothing via variable regularity terms to obtain finer mesh surfaces. Experiments on the LiTS, MSD pancreas tumor, MSD hippocampus, and MSD spleen datasets demonstrate that ToPoMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate a 57.4% reduction in Chamfer distance (liver) and a 0.47% improvement in F-score compared to end-to-end 3D reconstruction methods, while qualitative results confirm enhanced fidelity for thin structures and complex anatomical topologies versus segmentation frameworks.

During phase 1, participants received an online weight loss program. Those who achieved 5% or greater weight loss in phase 1 were eligible for phase 2, the actual 18-month WLM trial. Participants in the maintenance trial were randomized to either an entirely patient-delivered lifestyle intervention for WLM or SOC delivered by professional staff.

Nevertheless, its comprehensive roles in pan-cancer progression, underlying biological functions, and potential as a predictor of immunotherapy response remains poorly understood.\nMETHODS: We performed a comprehensive multi-omics pan-cancer analysis of CCT5 across 33 cancer types, integrating bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics data. CCT5 expression patterns, prognostic relevance, stemness association, and immune microenvironment relationships were evaluated. A novel CCT5-based signature (CCT5.Sig) was developed using machine learning on 23 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohorts (n = 1394) spanning eight cancer types. Model performance was assessed using AUC metrics and survival analyses.\nRESULTS: CCT5 was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues and primarily localized to malignant and cycling cells. High CCT5 expression correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers and was enriched in oncogenic, cell cycle, and DNA damage repair pathways. CCT5 expression was positively associated with mRNAsi, mDNAsi, and CytoTRACE scores, indicating a role in stemness maintenance.

If patients' seizures localize to a discrete brain region, termed a seizure onset zone, resection may be curative. Localization is often confirmed with stereotactic electroencephalography; however, this may require patients to stay in the hospital for weeks to capture spontaneous seizures. Automated localization of seizure onset zones could therefore improve presurgical evaluation and decrease morbidity.\nMETHODS: Using more than 1 000 000 interictal stereotactic electroencephalography segments collected from 78 patients, we performed five-fold cross-validation and testing on a multichannel, multiscale, one-dimensional convolutional neural network to classify seizure onset zones.\nRESULTS: Across held-out test sets, our models achieved a seizure onset zone classification sensitivity of .702 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .549-.805), specificity of .741 (95% CI = .652-.835), and accuracy of .738 (95% CI = .687-.795), which was significantly better than models trained on random labels. The models performed well across the entire brain, with top five region performance demonstrating accuracies between 70.0% and 88.4%. When split by outcomes, the models performed significantly better on patients with favorable Engel outcomes after resection or who were responsive neurostimulation responders. Finally, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) value analysis on median-normalized input data assigned consistently high feature importance to interictal spikes and large deflections, whereas similar analyses on histogram-equalized data revealed differences in feature importance assignments to low-amplitude segments.\nSIGNIFICANCE: This work serves as evidence that deep learning on brief interictal intracranial data can classify seizure onset zones across the brain.

However, public attitudes toward AI, including trust and risk perception, are key to its ethical and effective adoption. Despite growing interest, empirical research on the factors shaping public support for AI in health care (particularly in large-scale, representative contexts) remains limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate public attitudes toward AI in patient health care, focusing on how AI attributes (autonomy, costs, reliability, and transparency) shape perceptions of support, risk, and personalized care. In addition, it examines the moderating role of sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, educational level, migration background, and subjective health status) in these evaluations. Our study offers novel insights into the relative importance of AI system characteristics for public attitudes and acceptance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a factorial vignette experiment with a probability-based survey of 3030 participants from Germany's general population. Respondents were presented with hypothetical scenarios involving AI applications in diagnosis and treatment in a hospital setting. Linear regression models assessed the relative influence of AI attributes on the dependent variables (support, risk perception, and personalized care), with additional subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity by sociodemographic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Mean values between 4.2 and 4.4 on a 1-7 scale indicate a generally neutral to slightly negative stance toward AI integration in terms of general support, risk perception, and personalized care expectations, with responses spanning the full scale from strong support to strong opposition. Among the 4 dimensions, reliability emerges as the most influential factor (percentage of explained variance [EV] of up to 10.5%). Respondents expect AI to not only prevent errors but also exceed current reliability standards while strongly disapproving of nontraceable systems (transparency is another important factor, percentage of EV of up to 4%). Costs and autonomy play a comparatively minor role (percentage of EVs of up to 1.5% and 1.3%), with preferences favoring collaborative AI systems over autonomous ones, and higher costs generally leading to rejection. Heterogeneity analysis reveals limited sociodemographic differences, with education and migration background influencing attitudes toward transparency and autonomy, and gender differences primarily affecting cost-related perceptions. Overall, attitudes do not substantially differ between AI applications in diagnosis versus treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study fills a critical research gap by identifying the key factors that shape public trust and acceptance of AI in health care, particularly reliability, transparency, and patient-centered approaches.

Models using pre-vaccination antibody haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres against the vaccine strain alone poorly predict post-vaccination responses.\nMETHODS: We combined fifteen prior H3N2 influenza vaccine studies from 1997 to 2021, collectively containing 20,000 data points, and develop of a machine learning model that uses pre-vaccination HAI titres against multiple influenza variants to predict post-vaccination responses. To further test the model, four new vaccine studies were conducted in 2022-2023 spanning two geographic locations and three influenza vaccine types.\nFINDINGS: The most predictive pre-vaccination features were HAI titres against the vaccine strain and against historical influenza variants, with smaller predictive power derived from age, sex, vaccine dose, and geographic location. The resulting model predicted future responses even when the vaccine strain or vaccine formulation changed. A pre-vaccination feature-the time between peak HAI across recent variants-distinguished large versus small post-vaccination responses with 73% accuracy. Model predictions against prior vaccine studies had 2.4-fold error (95% CI: 2.34-2.40x, no large outliers with >4-fold error), yielding more accurate and robust predictions than a null model with 3.2-fold error (95% CI: 3.12-3.21x, 12% large outliers). The four new vaccine studies presented here were predicted with comparable accuracy to the intrinsic 2-fold error of the experimental assay.\nINTERPRETATION: A person's pre-vaccination influenza HAI titres using multiple variants are highly predictive of their post-vaccination response. Many individuals exhibited little-to-no vaccine response, as exhibited by the null model's accuracy, yet the machine learning model identified and accurately predicted both weak and strong responses with statistical superiority.

China's rapid technological adoption, large population, and supportive government policies position it as a potential global leader in DTx. However, challenges remain in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, product development, and reimbursement models. A comprehensive assessment of clinical evidence, commercialization trends, and regulatory frameworks is essential for understanding China's evolving DTx ecosystem and its global implications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews and analyzes the DTx landscape in China, focusing on clinical trials, commercial products, regulatory frameworks, and pricing and reimbursement models. The findings provide insights for countries aiming to develop, regulate, and integrate DTx solutions into health care systems.\nMETHODS: This comprehensive review integrates multiple methodological approaches to examine different aspects of the DTx ecosystem in China. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate clinical trials, searching PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until July 2024. Meta-analyses used random-effects models, reporting results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. For commercial products, a scoping review using the National Medical Products Administration database was performed. Regulatory policies were systematically identified through a manual review of official government sources, while pricing and reimbursement models were analyzed through a comprehensive assessment of public and private insurance policies, government initiatives, and commercial pathways.\nRESULTS: : A total of 96 clinical trials on DTx in China were identified, with cognitive disorders (n=21, 22%) and diabetes (n=20, 21%) being the most frequently studied, followed by cardiovascular diseases (n=8, 8%), sleeping disorders (n=6, 6%), and smoking cessation (n=6, 6%). Meta-analysis for diabetes DTx showed a trend toward improved hemoglobin A1c levels in digital intervention groups compared to controls (SMD -0.96, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.11) but did not reach statistical significance (I²=97%). Meta-analysis for cognitive disorder DTx showed significant improvement in global cognitive function in DTx-treated participants (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-0.94), despite notable heterogeneity (I²=71.7%). The commercial landscape analysis identified 97 active DTx solutions, primarily targeting cognitive impairment (38 companies), ophthalmic diseases (30 companies), and respiratory diseases (5 companies). The regulatory review highlighted China's reliance on general medical device policies under the National Medical Products Administration rather than DTx-specific regulations, with emerging regional innovation policies supporting industry growth. Pricing analysis revealed diverse reimbursement models, including value-based pricing, private insurance partnerships, and government-facilitated programs.\nCONCLUSIONS: China has made substantial progress in DTx development but still faces challenges in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, and reimbursement. Key factors driving DTx adoption include targeted indications, standardized clinical trials, streamlined regulation, and diversified pricing models. China's experience provides valuable lessons for other countries with emerging digital health ecosystems as they develop DTx research, regulations, and integration strategies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42024615584; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024615584.", "authors": ["Jiang Nan", "Yu Xiru", "Yang Yuxi", "Li Guanqiao", "He Chanchan", "Wang Man Ping", "Tham Yih Chung", "Wong Tien Yin", "Rao Keqin"], "published_date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "中國的數位療法：綜合回顧", "summary_zh": "數位療法(DTx)是透過軟體提供個人化、實證治療的創新方法。中國在數位療法領域具有巨大潛力，擁有龐大人口、快速發展的科技以及政府的支持政策。本研究全面回顧了中國數位療法的發展現況，包括臨床試驗、商業產品、法規框架以及定價與報銷模式。研究發現，中國在認知障礙和糖尿病等領域的數位療法臨床試驗數量最多，並在改善認知功能方面顯示出顯著效果。目前中國數位療法主要依賴現有的醫療器材法規，但各地區也開始出現支持產業發展的創新政策。儘管中國在數位療法發展上取得顯著進展，但在臨床試驗標準化、法規批准和報銷方面仍面臨挑戰。本研究結果可為其他國家發展數位療法提供寶貴經驗。", "applications": ["想像一下，阿茲海默症的早期患者，不用每天跑醫院，透過手機App就能進行認知訓練，延緩病情惡化，這就是數位療法帶來的便利。", "糖尿病患者常常需要頻繁監測血糖和調整飲食，現在透過數位療法App，可以獲得個人化的飲食建議和運動計畫，幫助他們更好地控制血糖，減少併發症的風險。", "有些小朋友有注意力不足過動症(ADHD)，透過數位遊戲，可以訓練他們的專注力，改善學習效率，而且是在輕鬆有趣的環境下進行，讓治療不再枯燥乏味。"], "audio": "audios/40424619.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T01:19:29.690839"}

FGR in patients with preeclampsia increases the risk of neonatal-perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, previous prediction methods for FGR are class-biased or clinically unexplainable, which makes it difficult to apply to clinical practice, leading to a relative delay in intervention and a lack of effective treatments.\nOBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop an auxiliary diagnostic model based on machine learning (ML) to predict the occurrence of FGR in patients with preeclampsia.\nMETHODS: This study used a retrospective case-control approach to analyze 38 features, including the basic medical history and peripheral blood laboratory test results of pregnant patients with preeclampsia, either complicated or not complicated by FGR. ML models were constructed to evaluate the predictive value of maternal parameter changes on preeclampsia combined with FGR. Multiple algorithms were tested, including logistic regression, light gradient boosting, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, and support vector machine. The model performance was identified by the area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation indexes. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was adopted to rank the feature importance and explain the final model for clinical application.\nRESULTS: The RF model performed best in discriminative ability among the 7 ML models. After reducing features according to importance rank, an explainable final RF model was established with 9 features, including urinary protein quantification, gestational week of delivery, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, amniotic fluid index, triglyceride, D-dimer, weight, height, and maximum systolic pressure. The model could accurately predict FGR for 513 patients with preeclampsia (149 with FGR and 364 without FGR) in the training and testing dataset (AUC 0.83, SD 0.03) using 5-fold cross-validation, which was closely validated for 103 patients with preeclampsia (n=45 with FGR and n=58 without FGR) in an external dataset (AUC 0.82, SD 0.048). On the whole, urinary protein quantification, umbilical artery systolic-to-diastolic ratio, and gestational week of delivery exhibited the highest contributions to the model performance (c=0.45, 0.34, and 0.33) based on SHAP analysis. For specific individual patients, SHAP results reveal the protective and risk factors to develop FGR for interpreting the model's clinical significance. Finally, the model has been translated into a convenient web page tool to facilitate its use in clinical settings.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study successfully developed a model that accurately predicts FGR development in patients with preeclampsia.

Existing diabetes apps offer features that enable integrations with various devices that streamline diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps, or regular activity trackers. While this reduces the tracking burden on the users, the research highlighted several issues with diabetes apps, including issues with reliability and trustworthiness. As pumps and continuous glucose monitors are safety-critical systems-where issues can result in serious harm or fatalities-it is important to understand what issues and vulnerabilities could be introduced by relying on popular diabetes apps as an interface for interacting with such devices.\nOBJECTIVE: As there is a lack of research examining in detail the integrations and potential suitability of apps as part of a wider self-management ecosystem, our goal was 2-fold. First, we aimed to understand the current landscape of device integrations within diabetes apps and how well they meet users' needs. Second, we identified the key issues users of the most popular apps face currently and what features are the source of these issues.\nMETHODS: Through searches in Android and iPhone app stores, we systematically identified 21 diabetes apps that offer integrations.

This study introduces a rigorous multivariate time series analysis, integrating meteorological factors with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, to predict DENV case trends across different temporal scales. Leveraging a robust data pipeline, this research incorporates a strategic downscaling technique, applying the Stochastic Bayesian Downscaling (SBD) algorithm to convert monthly DENV case data to daily frequency. This approach addresses key issues in the handling of sparse datasets and missing data, offering novel insights into the potential accuracy benefits of data downscaling in time series forecasting. Among the models assessed, the decision tree demonstrated superior performance on the actual monthly data, achieving an accuracy of 74.6 %  . In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of 95.8 %  , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a 28.5 %  improvement in accuracy and an 89.3 %  reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting.

Timely and precise detection of various stages of cervical cancer plays a crucial role in enhancing the chances of successful treatment and extending patient survival.

In our study, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Grassmann manifold (GM) learning are explored for reliable cancer detection using fluorescence spectral signals collected from 110 subjects representing various categories of the human cervix. Initially, EMD is used to decompose the signal into several multi-feature intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) on a spectral scale. Each IMF demonstrates uniqueness by capturing the inherent frequency characteristics within the signal, thus facilitating the extraction of signal features. The GM representation of IMFs is employed for investigating the non-linear subspace structure within spectral signals, which is subsequently followed by a low-rank representation to transform and analyze the spectral signals. The GM allows for the extraction of relevant information, reduction of dimensionality, and exploration of complex relationships within data, ultimately contributing to improved diagnosis. Mutual information is further used for feature selection to reduce the number of features and hence the computational cost.

Continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems have enhanced the quality of life and glycemic outcomes while reducing severe hypoglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis hospitalizations. Despite these benefits, racial inequities in the use of advanced diabetes technology (ADT) persist.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate a best practice advisory (BPA) within the electronic medical record (EMR) to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in ADT use. We hypothesize that an EMR-based BPA designed to standardize the prescribing of ADTs will minimize racial and ethnic disparities in ADT adoption or progression in use among pediatric and adult people with type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: The Best Practice Advisories to Reduce Inequities in Technology Use (BPA-TECH) study will use a nonrandomized matched pair intervention design. Phase 1 will use qualitative methods to develop and refine the BPA, including focus groups and surveys of health care providers and people with type 1 diabetes or their caregivers. Phase 2 will evaluate the effectiveness of the BPA through a controlled before-after study of people with type 1 diabetes seen at 7 T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) centers, with control people with type 1 diabetes matched from nonintervention T1DX-QI centers. The baseline and postintervention periods will be the 12 months before and 12 months after deployment of the BPA at the intervention centers, respectively. Eligibility criteria include people with type 1 diabetes aged ≥2 years with an EMR diagnosis of T1D during the baseline period. The primary outcome is the progression in ADT use from the baseline to postintervention periods.\nRESULTS: This 3-year study began in July 2024, with data collection from key stakeholders for phase 1 qualitative research beginning in August 2024. For phase 2, we estimate approximately 3000 eligible non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic people with type 1 diabetes at the intervention centers and 15,000 matched controls. Data on ADT use, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), severe hypoglycemic events, and diabetes ketoacidosis events will be collected via the T1DX-QI coordinating center. The study is powered to detect a between-group difference of 15% in the proportion of patients in the intervention and control groups in meeting the primary endpoint.

With a population of 148.88 million, India holds the world's largest goat population, comprising 41 recognized indigenous breeds. These goats provide milk, meat, and fiber, particularly in marginal environments. The genomic advancements in goat research have revolutionized the understanding of genetic diversity, adaptation, and trait improvement. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and transcriptomics have unveiled genetic markers associated with production, disease resistance, and reproductive traits. Genomic tools such as the Illumina Goat SNP50K BeadChip and high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of selection signatures and quantitative trait loci (QTL), influencing economically important traits like milk yield, meat quality, and prolificacy. Notably, genes such as DGAT1, GHR, BMPR1B, and HSP70 have been linked to production efficiency, reproductive performance, and climate resilience. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) have enabled precision breeding, enhancing genetic gains and reducing inbreeding risks. The application of RNA sequencing has provided insights into gene expression patterns governing lactation, growth, and reproductive efficiency. Epigenomic studies, focusing on DNA methylation and histone modifications, have highlighted regulatory mechanisms underpinning prolificacy and muscle development. Conservation genomics has played a pivotal role in safeguarding native breeds by assessing genetic diversity and mitigating inbreeding depression. Indicine goat breeds, such as Jamunapari, Beetal, Barbari, and Black Bengal, exhibit unique genetic adaptations to diverse agro-climatic conditions, emphasizing the need for their conservation. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, hold promise for precision breeding to enhance productivity and disease resistance.

In a recent study, our all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a nonlinearly large electroosmotic (EOS) flow (in the presence of an applied electric field) in nanochannels grafted with PMETAC [poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride] brushes. Given the lack of any formal procedure that would have directed us to identify the correct factors responsible for such an occurrence, we needed to devote several months to unraveling the involved mechanisms. In this letter, we propose a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based machine learning (ML) approach to address this gap. At first, we obtained data on certain basic features from the all-atom MD data. These basic features represent the number of atoms of a certain species around one atom of another (or the same) species. We obtain such data on basic features for a reference case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a smaller electric field) and a perturbed case (case of an EOS flow in PMETAC-brush-grafted nanochannels with a larger electric field) in bins into which the nanochannel half height has been divided. These data sets are high-dimensional data sets to which the LDA is applied. This leads to the projection of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) in a highly separated form on a 1D line. From such LDA calculations, we can identify the relative importance of the different basic features in ensuring this separation of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) on the 1D line. The relative importance of the different basic features is quantified as \"importance scores\" for the different features, which, in turn, tell us what to study and where to study.

Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates between groups. The primary outcome was incident delirium; secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess outcomes.\nRESULTS: After matching, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of delirium compared with metformin (ARR 5.03%, 3.97% vs. 9.0%; aHR 0.91 [95% CI 0.87, 0.95], P < 0.001).

While the digitalization of health care, including telemedicine and artificial intelligence, offers sustainability benefits, it also raises concerns about energy use and electronic waste. Balancing these factors is key to a sustainable health care future.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to examine the extent to which digitalization in the health care sector influences environmental sustainability. Specifically, it aimed to assess how digitalization can contribute to reducing the health care sector's impact on global climate change. From these findings, conclusions were drawn regarding the extent to which digitalization aligns with the objectives of the Planetary Health movement and how these 2 movements may mutually reinforce each other.\nMETHODS: A scoping review guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines using databases such as PubMed and Scopus was conducted, and 58 quantitative studies from 2009 to 2024 were analyzed for environmental, social, and economic outcomes aligned with Planetary Health goals.\nRESULTS: This review analyzed 58 studies on the environmental impact of digitalization in health care primarily focusing on telemedicine, which was examined in 91% (53/58) of the studies. Most studies (56/58, 97%) quantified transport-related emissions avoided through digitalization, with some also assessing emissions from health care facilities, medical equipment, and energy consumption. Findings indicated that telemedicine significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions, with total avoided emissions amounting to approximately 830 million kg. A substantial proportion of the studies (36/58, 62%) focused on social aspects, highlighting factors such as patient satisfaction, time efficiency, and overall convenience. In addition, economic considerations were analyzed in 48% (28/58) of the studies, emphasizing cost reductions and resource optimization. However, only 12% (7/58) of the studies evaluated the full life cycle impact of digital technologies, highlighting the need for further research on their long-term environmental sustainability.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review calls for further research beyond telemedicine, advocating for life cycle analyses and actionable strategies for a sustainable digitalization in health care systems.

Furthermore, our functional assays revealed that OVOL1 enhances the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Although ossification in tendon tissue has been reported in a range of aging and disease models, the underlying biomarkers and mechanisms remain unknown. And the characterisation and sensitivity of previous diagnostic biomarkers for tendon ectopic ossification do not meet the demands of clinical use. The aim of this study was to characterise the effects of aging on ossification in the mouse Achilles tendon and to identify characteristic genes and therapeutic targets for tendon ossification in mice by using a machine learning approach.\nMETHODS: We retrieved the transcriptome profile of GSE126118 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Following background correction and normalization using the transcripts per million (TPM) method, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the limma R package (p < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1). Subsequently, 468 senescence genes were downloaded from the Aging Atlas database, and senescence-associated DEGs (HO senescence genes) were identified. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted on the identified DEGs. To further refine the HO aging signature, support vector machine (SVM) regression was employed. Additionally, we predicted transcription factors, miRNAs, and small molecule drugs potentially associated with the characterized genes.\nRESULTS: Three characterised genes were identified as biomarkers associated with ectopic ossification and aging in the mouse Achilles tendon, Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment in processes related to cartilage endochondral ossification, metalloendopeptidase activity, and mitochondrial proton transport ATP synthase complex. Additionally, HIF-1 and GnRH signaling pathways were prominently represented among the differentially expressed genes.\nCONCLUSION: Atp5o, Mmp2 and Mmp13 were identified as relevant signature genes for the effects of aging on Achilles tendon ossification in mice. Atp5o, Mmp2, and Mmp13 may influence tendon ossification by affecting mitochondrial function as well as extracellular matrix degradation to regulate senescence.

Despite this, access to care is still poor. This study aimed to assess barriers/facilitators to access NCDs services for children, adolescents and young people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in Mozambique.\nMETHODS: A qualitative cross-sectional study using focus groups (FG) and key-informant interviews was conducted between September and October 2023, involving patients (16-30 years), caregivers of child and adolescent patients and health care staff of 5 health facilities. A deductive approach was adopted using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework to classify themes referring to barriers/facilitators to access. Two researchers carried out quantitative content analysis independently, assessing the inter-rater agreement through Cohen's K.\nRESULTS: Four FGs were conducted with 26 patients (61.5% female, 16-24 years), three with 18 caregivers (83.3% female) and 16 interviews with healthcare workers. A total of 455 themes were identified, with a predominance of barriers (67.3%) compared to facilitators (32.7%) in accessing T1DM services. The area ''Capability'' was labelled significantly more often as a barrier (89.5%) than ''Motivation'' and ''Opportunities'' (60.2% and 62.6%, p < 0.001). The most frequent barriers were related to the psychological ability to accept and manage the disease in the absence of professional psychological support, inadequate interactions with healthcare personnel, long waits in the outpatient clinic and stigma towards diabetes in the community. Social support from family and friends appears to be an important facilitator.

TGFβ is a promising target due to its significant involvement in the desmoplasia, immune suppression, and chemoresistance characteristic of pancreatic cancer. Over 300 clinical trials targeting TGFβ have been conducted in unselected patient cohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval. Nevertheless, TGFβ blockade may hold promise for a subset of cancers with non-functional TGFβ signaling. Greater than 25% of pancreatic cancers carry mutations in SMAD4, a key component of canonical TGFβ signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify tumors susceptible to TGFβ inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human pancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse disease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed heterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited reduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and protein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, treating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGFβ antibody reduced tumor weight and improved survival.

The robustness of the MFM-clustering algorithm was validated, offering enhanced pollutant classification accuracy compared to conventional statistical methods by focusing on pollutant-specific features. We used a systematic framework comprising field investigations, target screening, risk assessment, and MFM-clustering-based source analysis. The methodology was applied to the Bohai Sea, China, as a case study, where 29 OPEs, including 15 eOPEs, were quantified in sediment samples. This application refined the clustering analysis and enabled detailed ecological risk assessments. Industries associated with OPEs production, sewage treatment plants, industrial discharges, surface runoff from automotive activities, atmospheric transport of volatile OPEs, and petroleum-related operations for most eOPEs have been identified as key contributors to OPE pollution in various regions of the Bohai Sea.

However, accurately grading IBC presents a significant challenge due to its heterogeneous nature and the need to harness the complementary information from multiple nuclei sources in histopathology images. To tackle this critical problem, we introduce a novel multi-source hybrid feature fusion network named MSFusion. This network incorporates two types of hybrid features: deep learning features extracted by a novel Swin Transformer-based multi-branch network called MSwinT, and traditional handcrafted features that capture the morphological characteristics of multi-source nuclei. The primary branch of MSwinT captures the overall characteristics of the original images, while multiple auxiliary branches focus on identifying morphological features from diverse sources of nuclei, including tumor, mitotic, tubular, and epithelial nuclei. At each of the four stages for the branches in MSwinT, a functional KDC (key diagnostic components) fusion block with channel and spatial attentions is proposed to integrate the features extracted by all the branches. Ultimately, we synthesize the multi-source hybrid deep learning features and handcrafted features to improve the accuracy of IBC diagnosis and grading. Our multi-branch MSFusion network is rigorously evaluated on three distinct datasets, including two private clinical datasets (Qilu dataset and QDUH&SHSU dataset) as well as a publicly available Databiox dataset.

It is widely utilized for examining various organs, such as the breast, thyroid, ovary, cardiac, and more. However, the manual interpretation and annotation of ultrasound images are time-consuming and prone to variability among physicians. While single-task artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored, they are not ideal for scaling AI applications in medical imaging. Foundation models, although a trending solution, often struggle with real-world medical datasets due to factors such as noise, variability, and the incapability of flexibly aligning prior knowledge with task adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose an orchestration learning framework named PerceptGuide for general-purpose ultrasound classification and segmentation. Our framework incorporates a novel orchestration mechanism based on prompted hyper-perception, which adapts to the diverse inductive biases required by different ultrasound datasets. Unlike self-supervised pre-trained models, which require extensive fine-tuning, our approach leverages supervised pre-training to directly capture task-relevant features, providing a stronger foundation for multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound imaging. To support this research, we compiled a large-scale Multi-task, Multi-organ public ultrasound dataset (M2-US), featuring images from 9 organs and 16 datasets, encompassing both classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach employs four specific prompts-Object, Task, Input, and Position-to guide the model, ensuring task-specific adaptability. Additionally, a downstream synchronization training stage is introduced to fine-tune the model for new data, significantly improving generalization capabilities and enabling real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our framework in handling multi-task and multi-organ ultrasound image processing, outperforming both specialist models and existing general AI solutions.

Currently, DCIS that might progress to IBC cannot reliably be identified. Therefore, most patients with DCIS undergo treatment resembling IBC. To facilitate identification of low-risk DCIS, we developed deep learning models using histology whole-slide images (WSIs) and clinico-pathological data.\nMETHODS: We predicted invasive recurrence in patients with primary, pure DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery using clinical Cox proportional hazards models and deep learning. Deep learning models were trained end-to-end with only WSIs or in combination with clinical data (integrative). We employed nested k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) on a Dutch multicentre dataset (n = 558). Models were also tested on the UK-based Sloane dataset (n = 94).\nFINDINGS: Evaluated over 20 years on the Dutch dataset, deep learning models using only WSIs effectively stratified patients into low-risk (no recurrence) and high-risk (invasive recurrence) groups (negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.83); hazard ratio (HR) = 4.48 (95% CI: 3.41-5.88, p < 0.0001); area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79)).

Furthermore, external validation of the models was unsuccessful, limited by the small size and low number of cases (22/94) in our external dataset, WSI quality, as well as the lack of well-annotated datasets that allow robust validation.\nINTERPRETATION: Deep learning models using routinely processed WSIs hold promise for DCIS risk stratification, while the benefits of integrating clinical data merit further investigation.

An important step involved in brachytherapy is the delineation of organs at risk (OARs) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Automating OARs segmentation in brachytherapy has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of radiation therapy planning. This paper introduces a novel segmentation model named MFFUNet for the automatic contour delineation of OARs in cervical cancer brachytherapy. The proposed model employs a staged encoder-decoder structure, integrating the self-attention mechanism of Transformer with the CNN framework. A novel multi-features fusion (MFF) block with a cross-attention-guided feature fusion mechanism is also proposed, which efficiently extracts and cross-fuses features from multiple receptive fields, enriching the semantic information of the features and thus improving the performance of complex segmentation tasks. A private CT image dataset of 95 patients with cervical cancer undergoing brachytherapy is used to evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed method. The OARs in the data consist of the bladder, rectum, and colon surrounding the cervix. The proposed model surpasses current mainstream OARs segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy. The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of all three OARs has achieved 73.69%. Among them, the DSC score for the bladder is 92.65%, for the rectum is 66.55%, and for the colon is 61.86%. Moreover, we also conducted experiments on two common public thoracoabdominal multi-organ CT datasets.

Using flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assays, we demonstrated a significant decrease in cytotoxicity and activation of NK92 cells against BCa upon CD56 deletion. Further, migration assays and atomic force microscopy showed CD56 deletion impaired NK92 cell migration and adhesion to bladder tumor cells, reducing NK92 cell-mediated apoptosis of BCa cells. Prolonged exposure to bladder tumors led to CD56 loss in NK92 cells, suggesting tumor-induced NK92 cell dysfunction via CD56 reduction, consistent with our previous findings. Confocal microscopy revealed an overlap of CD56 and phosphorylated Pyk2, a critical kinase at the tumor-immune synapse, potentially mediating the downstream cytotoxicity effects. Blocking Pyk2 phosphorylation decreased CD56-mediated NK92 cell activation and reduced NK92 cell-mediated cytotoxicity against BCa.

Recent studies highlight its unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms, showing that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can activate both the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This leads to a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviation of inflammation. Such neuroimmune regulation provides valuable insights for managing chronic inflammatory diseases, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pneumonia, and Crohn's disease. This review summarizes the functional roles of the vagus nerve in inflammatory diseases and the underlying mechanisms. It discusses how the vagus nerve regulates neural, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders through neurotransmitters, receptors, and anti-inflammatory pathways. Specifically, VNS has been shown to reduce inflammation by releasing acetylcholine, which binds to α7nAChR on immune cells and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both clinical and preclinical studies emphasize the effectiveness of non-invasive VNS in treating conditions such as stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further supporting the vagus nerve's potential as a therapeutic target. This paper also emphasizes the need for future research to better understand the specific mechanisms by which the vagus nerve modulates immune responses. Furthermore, validating the safety and efficacy of VNS through multi-center clinical trials is essential, alongside exploring personalised therapies using advanced biotechnology for precise modulation.

However, its yield is often affected by various leaf diseases. Early identification of maize leaf disease through easily accessible tool is required to increase the yield of maize. Recently, researchers have attempted to detect and classify maize leaf diseases using Deep Learning algorithms. However, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, nearly all the studies are concentrated on developing an offline model that can detect maize diseases. But, those models are not easily accessible to individuals and don't provide immediate feedback and monitoring. Thus, in this study, we developed a novel real-time, user-friendly maize leaf disease detection and classification mobile application. The VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50 models were implemented and compared their performance on maize disease detection and classification. A total of 4188 images of blight, common_rust, grey_leaf_spot, and healthy were used to train each model. Data augmentation techniques were applied to the dataset to increase the size of the dataset, which can also reduce model overfitting. Weighted cross-entropy loss was also employed to mitigate class-imbalance problems. After training, VGG16 achieved 95% of testing accuracy, AlexNet achieved 91%, and ResNet50 achieved 72% of testing accuracy. The VGG16 model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.

However, factors influencing bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in Chinese individuals with T2D remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biochemical determinants of BMD and TBS in patients with T2D, with a focus on elucidating the role of weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) in modulating bone mass and quality in this cohort.\nMETHODS: Data of 161 women and 153 men with T2D collected between July 2022 and March 2023 in Shenzhen, China, were analyzed in our cross-sectional study. Lumbar spine BMD and TBS of all participants were obtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. WWI was defined as waist circumference over the square root of weight.\nRESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that lumbar spine TBS was inversely correlated with age, menopausal status, and WWI in women (p < 0.05). In men, TBS was negatively associated with age and WWI (p < 0.05). For women, glycated hemoglobin A1c positively influenced BMD (p < 0.05), whereas age, diabetic retinopathy, and N-mid osteocalcin were negatively associated. No significant predictors of BMD were identified in the male cohort. For predicting degraded TBS, the optimal WWI cut-offs were 11.257 cm/√kg (S: 61.1%, E: 80.7%) in males and 11.247 cm/√kg (S: 70.3%, E: 71.1%) in females.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight WWI as a novel and potentially more precise indicator of body fat, associated with diminished bone quality rather than solely low bone mass in patients with T2D in China.

Leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator for assessing the growth condition and yield potential of rice, and the traditional methods for obtaining LAI have problems such as low efficiency and large error. With the development of remote sensing technology, unmanned aerial multispectral remote sensing combined with deep learning technology provides a new way for efficient and accurate estimation of LAI in rice.\nRESULTS: In this study, a multispectral camera mounted on a UAV was utilized to acquire rice canopy image data, and rice LAI was uniformly estimated over multiple periods by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models in deep learning. The results showed that the CNN model based on five-band reflectance images (490, 550, 670, 720, and 850 nm) as input after feature screening exhibited high estimation accuracy at different growth stages.

Further, the aim is to assess the potential efficacy of the intervention in reducing maternal and neonatal health complications compared with standard care.\nMETHODS: VALID-II is a two-site, two-arm, non-randomised feasibility intervention study in Thai Binh Province in northern Vietnam with a delayed start for the intervention group. The intervention study is nested in a larger cohort. In total, 2000 pregnant women will be screened for GDM, with an estimated 400 women screening positive according to the World Health Organisation-International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group diagnostic criteria. First, 200 women who screen positive for GDM will be assigned to a control group that will receive standard care. Among the 200 women, 20 will take part in an in-depth ethnographic study along with their family members, and the intervention will be co-created with them. Second, once the intervention has been created, 200 women will be assigned to the intervention group, which will receive the intervention plus standard care. Twenty women and their families from the intervention group will also take part in an ethnographic study.

A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).\nRESULTS: The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate.

Currently, selection of brachytherapy applicators relies on physician's clinical experience, which can lead to variability in treatment quality and outcomes. This study presents a deep learning-based decision-support tool for selecting between interstitial Syed applicators and intracavitary tandem & ovoids applicators.\nAPPROACH: The network architecture consists of six 3D convolutional-pooling-ReLU blocks, followed by a fully connected block. The input to the network includes three channels: a 3D contour mask of clinical target volume (CTV), organs at risk (OAR), and central tandem, and two 3D distance maps of CTV and OAR voxels relative to the tandem's central axis. The network outputs a probability score, indicating the suitability of Syed applicators. Binary cross-entropy loss combined with L1 regularization was used for network training.\nMAIN RESULTS: A retrospective study was performed on 184 LACC patients with 422 instances of applicator insertion. The data was divided into three sets: Dataset-1 of 163 patients with 372 insertions for training and hyperparameter tuning, Dataset-2 of 17 patients with 36 insertions and Dataset-3 of four complex cases with 14 insertions for testing.

However, differences in demographics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes across colon cancer stages and locations between these databases remain incompletely understood. Addressing these disparities is crucial for researchers when selecting the most appropriate registry for survival analysis.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically compare patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates between NCDB and SEER across various tumor locations and disease stages in colon cancer.\nMETHODS: We analyzed patients undergoing surgery for Stages I-IV primary colon cancer (2004-2019), comparing patient characteristics, oncologic outcomes, and OS rates across distinct tumor locations and cancer stages in NCDB and SEER. Our objective was to assess how differences in database structure and sampling methodologies influence reported survival outcomes.\nRESULTS: The study included 777 827 patients (NCDB: 572 196; SEER: 205 631). Proximal colon cancers were more common in older and female patients in both databases, whereas distal colon cancers were more prevalent in younger patients. NCDB contained a slightly higher proportion of Caucasian patients, while SEER had a greater representation of Asian patients. Segmental resections were more frequent in SEER, with the highest weighted difference observed in sigmoid colon cancer (6.16%; 95% CI: 5.78%-6.54%). OS rates were generally comparable across databases, though minor variations were observed at different colonic locations and stages.\nCONCLUSION: Despite differences in sampling techniques and follow-up reporting, NCDB and SEER demonstrated remarkable consistency in survival trends across colon cancer stages and locations. Recognizing these database-specific variations is essential for researchers conducting population-based survival analyses and selecting the most suitable registry for their studies. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE?: This study provides a comprehensive comparison of NCDB and SEER, highlighting how differences in sampling methodologies, follow-up reporting, and patient representation influence overall survival estimates in colon cancer.

However, it is not clearly established how addition of psyllium impacts properties of potato products and starch digestibility. Starch digestion initiates during oral processing, critically affecting its bioavailability. This study aimed to evaluate how psyllium-induced changes in rheological properties, chewing duration, and bolus characteristics alter starch digestibility during habitual mastication in mashed potatoes (MP).\nRESULTS: The incorporation of psyllium into an MP sample containing κ-carrageenan led to significant improvements in mechanical properties, including a 20% increase in hardness and a 15% increase in cohesiveness. Enhanced gel strength was further corroborated by elevated storage (G') and complex (G*) moduli values. These modifications necessitated prolonged chewing to achieve a swallowable bolus. Notably, the psyllium-containing bolus exhibited greater hardness and reduced fragmentation immediately prior to swallowing. Despite its enhanced rigidity, the MP-carrageenan- psyllium bolus was ingested without difficulty, likely attributable to psyllium's cohesiveness-enhancing effects. This combination of increased cohesiveness and diminished fragmentation contributed to a beneficial 20% reduction in starch digestion during mastication of psyllium-enriched MP samples.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that psyllium incorporation into MP can beneficially modulate its textural properties and bolus characteristics, resulting in reduced starch digestion.

Radiologists' evaluations are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing automated approaches often require large CT datasets with predefined image quality assessment (IQA) scores, which often do not align well with clinical evaluations. We aim to develop a reference-free, automated method for CT IQA that closely reflects radiologists' evaluations, reducing the dependency on large annotated datasets.\nAPPROACH: We propose Task-Focused Knowledge Transfer (TFKT), a deep learning-based IQA method leveraging knowledge transfer from task-similar natural image datasets. TFKT incorporates a hybrid convolutional neural network-transformer model, enabling accurate quality predictions by learning from natural image distortions with human-annotated mean opinion scores. The model is pre-trained on natural image datasets and fine-tuned on low-dose computed tomography perceptual image quality assessment data to ensure task-specific adaptability.\nRESULTS: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed TFKT method effectively predicts IQA scores aligned with radiologists' assessments on in-domain datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain clinical pediatric CT exams. The model achieves robust performance without requiring high-dose reference images. Our model is capable of assessing the quality of ∼ 30  CT image slices in a second.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed TFKT approach provides a scalable, accurate, and reference-free solution for CT IQA.

The continuous creation of large volumes of assessment items, in a consistent format and comparatively restricted time, is laborious. The application of technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been tried to address this challenge. A major concern raised is the validity of the information produced by AI tools, and if not properly verified, it can produce inaccurate and therefore inappropriate assessments.\nOBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the content validity and consistency of different AI chatbots in creating single best answer (SBA) questions, a refined format of multiple choice questions better suited to assess higher levels of knowledge, for undergraduate medical students.\nMETHODS: This study followed 3 steps. First, 3 researchers used a unified prompt script to generate 10 SBA questions across 4 chatbot platforms. Second, assessors evaluated the chatbot outputs for consistency by identifying similarities and differences between users and across chatbots. With 3 assessors and 10 learning objectives, the maximum possible score for any individual chatbot was 30. Third, 7 assessors internally moderated the questions using a rating scale developed by the research team to evaluate scientific accuracy and educational quality.\nRESULTS: In response to the prompts, all chatbots generated 10 questions each, except Bing, which failed to respond to 1 prompt. ChatGPT-4 exhibited the highest variation in question generation but did not fully satisfy the \"cover test.\" Gemini performed well across most evaluation criteria, except for item balance, and relied heavily on the vignette for answers but showed a preference for one answer option. Bing scored low in most evaluation areas but generated appropriately structured lead-in questions. SBA questions from GPT-3.5, Gemini, and ChatGPT-4 had similar Item Content Validity Index and Scale Level Content Validity Index values, while the Krippendorff alpha coefficient was low (0.016). Bing performed poorly in content clarity, overall validity, and item construction accuracy. A 2-way ANOVA without replication revealed statistically significant differences among chatbots and domains (P<.05). However, the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant difference) post hoc test showed no significant pairwise differences between individual chatbots, as all comparisons had P values >.05 and overlapping CIs.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI chatbots can aid the production of questions aligned with learning objectives, and individual chatbots have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Therefore, real-time prediction models play a key role in the clinical diagnosis and management of sepsis. However, the existing sepsis prediction models based on artificial intelligence still have limitations, such as poor real-time performance and insufficient interpretation.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective is to develop a real-time sepsis prediction model that integrates high timeliness and clinical interpretability. The model is designed to dynamically predict the risk of sepsis in ICU patients and establish a practical, tailored sepsis prediction platform.\nMETHODS: Within a retrospective analysis framework, the model comprises a real-time prediction module and an interpretability module. The real-time prediction module leverages 3-hour dynamic temporal features derived from 8 noninvasive, real-time physiological indicators: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and blood glucose. Three linear parameters (mean, SD, and endpoint value) were calculated to construct the prediction model using multiple ML algorithms. The interpretability module uses the TreeSHAP (Tree-Based Shapley Additive Explanations) method to enhance model transparency through both individual prediction and global explanations. Further, it added a link between the output interpretation of the explainable artificial intelligence method and its potential physiological or pathophysiological significance, including the relationship among the output interpretation and the patient's hemodynamics, thermoregulatory response, and the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. Finally, a web-based platform was developed to integrate prediction and interpretability functions.\nRESULTS: The sepsis prediction model demonstrated robust performance in the test cohort (224 patients), achieving an accuracy of 0.7 (95% CI 0.68-0.71), precision of 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.71), F1-score of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67-0.70), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74-0.77). The TreeSHAP method effectively visualized feature contributions, enabling clinicians to interpret the model's prediction logic and identify anomalies. The link between the output interpretation of the model and its potential physiological or pathophysiological significance improved the interpretability and credibility of the explainable artificial intelligence method. The web-based platform significantly enhanced clinical utility by providing real-time risk assessment, statistical summaries, trend analysis, and actionable insights.\nCONCLUSIONS: This platform provides real-time dynamic warnings for sepsis risk in critically ill ICU patients, supporting timely clinical decision-making.", "authors": ["Zhang Mingwei", "Zhong Ming", "Cheng Yunzhang", "Zhang Tianyi"], "published_date": "2025-05-30", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "基於即時動態時間特徵的敗血症風險智慧預測平台：設計研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究開發了一個智慧預測平台，旨在即時預測加護病房（ICU）患者罹患敗血症的風險。該平台利用八項非侵入性的生理指標，包括心率、呼吸頻率、血氧飽和度等，並分析這些指標在三小時內的動態變化。透過機器學習演算法，建立高準確度的預測模型。更重要的是，平台採用TreeSHAP方法，提供模型預測結果的可解釋性，讓醫生了解模型判斷的依據，例如哪些生理指標的變化最為關鍵，並將這些變化與患者的生理狀態聯繫起來。最終，研究團隊開發了一個網頁平台，整合了預測和解釋功能，協助醫生即時評估風險、分析趨勢，並做出更明智的臨床決策，以期降低敗血症患者的死亡率。", "applications": ["想像一下，醫院的加護病房裡，有了這個系統，就像有了一個24小時的AI醫生，隨時監控病人的狀況，一旦發現敗血症的風險，就能立即發出警報，讓醫生可以及早介入治療，提高病人的存活率。", "如果你的家人因為手術或其他原因住進了加護病房，醫生可以使用這個平台，更精準地掌握他們的身體狀況，預測敗血症的風險。這樣一來，就能夠防患於未然，避免病情惡化，讓家人可以安心接受治療。", "這個平台不只可以預測敗血症，還可以幫助醫生了解哪些生理指標對於判斷病情最重要。透過分析這些指標，醫生可以更深入地了解敗血症的發病機制，進而開發出更有效的治療方法，造福更多的病人。"], "audio": "audios/40446292.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-31T01:16:36.405198"}

Specifically, within the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) population, HPV vaccination adherence remains a complex issue. Due to the widespread use of technology within the young adult population, digital health tools such as digital storytelling (DST) have been promoted as an effective way to increase vaccination uptake.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a formative inquiry into (1) what components should be considered for inclusion in an HPV documentary tailored for sexual and gender minority populations and (2) what dissemination channels would be more effective and impact the uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine among sexual and gender minority populations. Additionally, this study aims to provide insight into perceived HPV risk and its implications on the HPV vaccine uptake within the LGBTQ+ population.\nMETHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted between January 2021 and September 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. Intake surveys were distributed to individuals identifying as members of the LGBTQ+ community to examine demographic characteristics, barriers to vaccine adherence, and current HPV vaccination status. Perceived HPV risk was assessed using 5 statements on a 1 to 7 Likert scale. Key informant interviews were conducted via Zoom with participants who completed the intake surveys and consented to be interviewed. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using the constant comparison method for emergent themes surrounding components of effective DST campaigns.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven individuals completed the intake survey and interview.

The shift to outpatient postoperative care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizes the need for effective management of postoperative outcomes. The high rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Korea necessitate focused transitional care during patient discharge periods. However, limited research exists on the postoperative experiences of discharged patients, underscoring the necessity of establishing evidence-based services to optimize transitional care.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to analyze the emotional experiences of patients who underwent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular surgeries using data from Naver, a major South Korean web portal.\nMETHODS: Posts were collected using specific keywords and processed with the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KoBERT) model based on Transformer, which classified sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. Model performance was validated according to precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Sentiment analysis was conducted within the Transitional Care Model (TCM) framework, divided into 5 domains: health status, care resources, care demand, interaction, and mental state.\nRESULTS: The KoBERT model demonstrated high classification performance, achieving a precision of 96%, recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 94%. Sentiment analysis revealed that compared with cardiovascular surgery patients, cerebrovascular surgery patients experienced higher negative emotions regarding health status, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients expressed more negative sentiments in care demands.\nCONCLUSIONS: Different patient groups experience distinct emotional and practical challenges postdischarge. Particularly, keywords within the TCM framework highlight that cerebrovascular surgery patients require robust rehabilitation and caregiver support, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients need better cost management.

Combining an unsupervised machine learning technique and density functional theory calculations, we validated the system size for quantum calculations and investigated the impact of SCs on the excited states. Then, following the sequential QM/MM approach, we determined the absorption spectra of each polymer.

Clinician-patient communication is central to promoting the uptake of and adherence to digital health behavior change interventions.

This study also aims to explore oncologists' informational and technological support requirements to facilitate these conversations.\nMETHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 18 oncologists who provide cancer care in a large National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. The transcripts and interview notes were analyzed through an iterative thematic analysis to generate relevant themes and categories.\nRESULTS: We identified 2 major themes with 7 subthemes. The first theme focused on oncologists' desired roles in promoting health behavior change, while the second theme addressed the support needs to facilitate conversations about risk and health promotion. Oncologists expressed a desire for 2 action-oriented communication mechanisms for promoting digital health behavior change with their patients: referring patients to interventions and reinforcing intervention goals longitudinally. To facilitate risk behavior and health behavior change conversations, their support needs included a preference for low-burden, electronic health record-integrated tools providing timely updates on patient enrollment and progress. The participating oncologists requested a tailored conversation aid for patient communication and parallel systems combining electronic health record messaging with print materials. They also emphasized the need for automated recommender systems to identify and refer eligible patients and reminder systems to prompt timely discussions with patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oncologists are motivated and well-positioned to support patients' health behavior change but have unmet informational and technological requirements. On the basis of oncologists' perspectives, our findings provide actionable, user-centered, low-burden strategies for facilitating oncologist-patient conversations about digital health behavior change interventions.

Managing the disease remains a significant challenge, especially with the risks and severe side effects of current treatments, underscoring the need for safer and more effective therapies. Natural sources, particularly flavonoids, have shown considerable promise in reducing blood glucose levels. Flavonoids, a diverse group of bioactive compounds found in various medicinal plants, have demonstrated potent antidiabetic properties. Notable flavonoids, such as apigenin, arbutin, catechins, and cyanidin, have been shown to lower blood glucose and enhance insulin secretion. Their clinical effectiveness is attributed to their ability to regulate metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal several mechanisms of action at the molecular, cellular, and subcellular levels, including the activation of glycolytic pathways and the inhibition of glucose synthesis and storage. This review provides an overview of the clinical potential of flavonoids in diabetes management, detailing their molecular mechanisms of action. Although flavonoids show promising results in reducing fasting blood glucose levels, most human studies have been short-term supplementation trials and lack long-term safety data and evidence for sustained glucose regulation.

However, if this target is to be achieved, efforts will need to be increased, as full coverage of essential services remains an issue. Access to quality, acceptable and affordable healthcare remains an illusion for many Ugandans. Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable tool in achieving UHC as it can increase access to health facilities in hard-to-reach areas. AI tools have also been reported to perform faster than humans at certain key health tasks like diagnosis. However, for AI to be effective in delivering its benefits, context-specific regulatory approaches are key, as needs and opportunities differ. In this paper, I argue that the regulation of AI can help make it an effective tool for achieving UHC in Uganda if the right regulatory approach and framework are adopted, as regulation shapes outcomes. This will tackle the risk of poor regulation hindering AI development and AI reinforcing inequalities.\nMETHODS: The paper employs a doctrinal methodology to analyse the two prominent regulatory approaches to AI in the EU and UK, which have adopted a risk-based and principles-based approach, respectively. It investigates whether these approaches are suitable for regulating AI in Uganda's healthcare and achieving UHC. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are examined. The paper advocates for considering a human rights-based approach that can be integrated with the principles-based approach.\nRESULTS: Regulation is a double-edged tool that can positively or negatively shape health outcomes. Good regulation has the potential to emancipate ordinary people's lives. Therefore, Uganda should leverage the positive aspects of principles-based and human rights-based approaches to regulation to ensure that AI's potential to achieve UHC is effective.\nCONCLUSION: The hybrid approach to AI regulation is best suited to serve Uganda's healthcare needs.

Participants were divided into two groups: 30 mothers received AI-based counseling, and 30 mothers were provided a booklet. Data collection tools included a personal information form, Breastfeeding Charting System and Assessment Tool (LATCH), Postnatal Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Data were collected from mothers who delivered at a state hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department and were followed for ten days postpartum (postpartum days 1, 3, 7, and 10).\nRESULTS: No significant differences were found in the demographic characteristics of the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant improvements were observed in breastfeeding self-efficacy over time for both groups (AI group: f = 36.356, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 43.349, p = 0.000). At day 10, the AI group scored significantly higher than the booklet group (Z=-2.216, p = 0.027). For breastfeeding success, as measured by the LATCH tool, significant differences were also noted over time for both groups (AI group: f = 68.466, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 68.088, p = 0.000). At day seven, the AI group outperformed the booklet group (Z=-2.995, p = 0.003). Anxiety levels showed no significant differences between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-based breastfeeding counseling positively impacts breastfeeding self-efficacy and success. The findings highlight the potential of AI applications in healthcare. AI-based chatbots can serve as effective tools for breastfeeding education, offering accessible, personalized, and continuous support. The significant improvements in breastfeeding outcomes indicate that innovative AI-assisted interventions can effectively support mothers during the critical early postpartum period.

However, up to 50% of patients do not achieve sufficient symptom relief. Identifying patient characteristics predictive of higher post-treatment symptom severity is crucial for devising personalized interventions to avoid treatment failures and reduce healthcare costs.\nMETHODS: Using the Swedish multimodal database MULTI-PSYCH, we evaluated novel and established predictors associated with treatment outcome and assessed the added benefit of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and nationwide register data in a sample of 2668 patients treated with ICBT for major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Two linear regression models were compared: a baseline model employing six well-established predictors and a full model incorporating six clinic-based, 32 register-based predictors, and PRS for seven psychiatric disorders and traits. Predictor importance was assessed through bivariate associations, and models were compared by the variance explained in post-treatment symptom scores.\nRESULTS: Our analysis identified several novel predictors of higher post-treatment severity, including comorbid ASD and ADHD, receipt of financial benefits, and prior use of psychotropic medications. The baseline model explained 27%, while the full model accounted for 34% of the variance.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a model incorporating a broad array of multimodal data offered a modest improvement in explanatory power compared to one using a limited set of easily accessible measures.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, offers innovative ways for enhancing communication skills training by simulating realistic conversational scenarios and providing personalised, adaptive feedback. This manuscript is presented as study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled trial that aims at evaluating the efficacy of an AI-supported higher education training protocol incorporating generative AI exercises to enhance communication competencies among psychology students.\nMETHODS: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, psychology students enrolled in communication skill seminars at a medium sized university in a medium sized German city will participate.

Additional non-randomised comparison classes will comprise students with TAU only, but not be part of main analyses. The primary outcome is the change in communication skills from baseline, assessed through questions reflecting the communication techniques emphasised in the training. Secondary outcomes include communication skills, self-efficacy and self-concept, motivation, attitudes toward AI, user experience with the AI tool, student evaluations of course quality, and feasibility aspects such as uptake and usability.

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a paradigm shift in the practice of health sciences particularly in medicine. In the dental field, AI has been scarcely used in the various disciplines with no application in dental traumatology. This study proposes a deep-learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based model for detection and classification of dental fractures.\nMETHODS: Plain periapical radiographs of injured teeth were retrieved from patients' records and annotated by two dentists trained in dental traumatology. The teeth were categorised into four groups: uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures and root fractures. Data augmentation was done to enhance the power of the current dataset. Images were divided into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Python programming language was used to implement the CNN-based classification model. Cross validation was applied.\nRESULTS: A total of 72 plain periapical radiographs of 108 fractured teeth were collected. The model achieved high accuracy in differentiating uncomplicated crown fractures from complicated ones (96.0%), from crown-root fractures (99.1%) and from root fractures (98.7%). Furthermore, the complicated injuries were distinguished from crown-root fractures and from root fractures with accuracy levels at 96.3% and 97.2% respectively.

The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has automated treatment planning, significantly improving efficiency. However, existing automatic treatment planning agents often rely on supervised or unsupervised AI models that require large datasets of high-quality patient data for training. Additionally, these networks are generally not universally applicable across patient cases from different institutions and can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which mimics the trial-and-error process used by human planners, offers a promising new approach to address these challenges.  PURPOSE: This work aims to develop a stochastic policy-based DRL agent for automatic treatment planning that facilitates effective training with limited datasets, universal applicability across diverse patient datasets, and robust performance under adversarial attacks.\nMETHODS: We employ an actor-critic with experience replay (ACER) architecture to develop the automatic treatment planning agent. This agent operates the treatment planning system (TPS) for inverse treatment planning by automatically tuning treatment planning parameters (TPPs). We use prostate cancer IMRT patient cases as our testbed, which includes one target and two organs at risk (OARs), along with 18 discrete TPP tuning actions. The network takes dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as input and outputs a policy for effective TPP tuning, accompanied by an evaluation function for that policy. Training utilizes DVHs from treatment plans generated by an in-house TPS under randomized TPPs for a single patient case, with validation conducted on two other independent cases. Both online asynchronous learning and offline, sample-efficient experience replay methods are employed to update the network parameters. After training, six groups, comprising more than 300 initial treatment plans drawn from three datasets, were used for testing. These groups have beam and anatomical configurations distinct from those of the training case. The ProKnow scoring system for prostate cancer IMRT, with a maximum score of 9, is used to evaluate plan quality. The robustness of the network is further assessed through adversarial attacks using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM).\nRESULTS: Despite being trained on treatment plans from a single patient case, the network converges efficiently when validated on two independent cases. For testing performance, the mean ± $\\pm$  standard deviation of the plan scores across all test cases before ACER-based treatment planning is  6.17 ± 1.90 $6.17 \\pm 1.90$  . After implementing ACER-based treatment planning,  92.29 % $92.29\\%$  of the cases achieve a perfect score of 9, with only  6.65 % $6.65\\%$  scoring between 8 and 9, and no cases being below 7. The corresponding mean ± $\\pm$  standard deviation is  8.92 ± 0.29 $8.92 \\pm 0.29$  . This performance highlights the ACER agent's high generality across patient data from various sources. Further analysis indicates that the ACER agent effectively prioritizes leading reasonable TPP tuning actions over obviously unsuitable ones by several orders of magnitude, showing its efficacy. Additionally, results from FGSM attacks demonstrate that the ACER-based agent remains comparatively robust against various levels of perturbation.\nCONCLUSIONS: We successfully trained a DRL agent using the ACER technique for high-quality treatment planning in prostate cancer IMRT.

To overcome this challenge, in this work, we explore various ways of introducing the latent information present in evolutionarily related sequences (homologous sequences) into the training process. To do so, we establish several strategies based on semi-supervised learning (unsupervised pre-processing and wrapper methods) and perform a comprehensive comparison using 19 datasets containing protein-fitness pairs. Our findings reveal that using the information present in the homologous sequences can improve the performance of the models, especially when the number of available labelled sequences is considerably low.

We designed a multi-modal deep-learning framework that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to analyze MRI and additional neural networks to evaluate demographic data. Our initial model focused on predicting brain age, serving as a foundational model from which we developed separate models for cognition function and amyloid plaque prediction through transfer learning.\nRESULTS: The brain age prediction model achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) for cognitive normal population in the ADNI (test) datasets of 3.302 years.

For clinical applications, accurate and rapid temperature feedback is essential to ensure both the safety and effectiveness of these treatments.\nPURPOSE: This work aims to improve temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstructions using an enhanced deep-learning method, thereby supporting the real-time monitoring required for effective FUS treatments.\nMETHODS: Five classical neural network architectures-cascade net, complex-valued U-Net, shift window transformer for MRI, real-valued U-Net, and U-Net with residual blocks-along with training-optimized methods were applied to reconstruct temperature maps from 2-fold and 4-fold undersampled k-space data. The training enhancements included pre-training/training-phase data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and a novel amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. Phantom and ex vivo tissue heating experiments were conducted using a FUS transducer. Ground truth was the complex MR images with accurate temperature changes, and datasets were manually undersampled to simulate such acceleration here. Separate testing datasets were used to evaluate real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed deep learning-based rapid reconstruction approach was validated on a clinical dataset obtained from patients with uterine fibroids, demonstrating its clinical applicability.\nRESULTS: Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were achieved for 2× and 4× k-space under samplings, respectively. The deep learning-based reconstruction using ResUNet incorporating the four optimizations, showed superior performance. For 2-fold acceleration, the RMSE of temperature map patches were 0.89°C and 1.15°C for the phantom and ex vivo testing datasets, respectively. The DICE coefficient for the 43°C isotherm-enclosed regions was 0.81, and the Bland-Altman analysis indicated a bias of -0.25°C with limits of agreement of ±2.16°C. In the 4-fold under-sampling case, these evaluation metrics showed approximately a 10% reduction in accuracy.

Salivary biomarkers, including beta-defensin-2 (BD-2) and statherin (STATH), offer potential as non-invasive tools for detecting and assessing the risk of ECC. This study aims to compare the levels of salivary statherin and beta-defensin-2, alongside oral health behaviors and demographic factors, in children both with and without early childhood caries.\nMETHODS: This case-control study involved 75 children diagnosed with ECC and 75 age- and gender-matched caries-free controls. Unstimulated saliva samples were obtained and analyzed via ELISA to quantify the levels of beta-defensin-2 and statherin. Demographic and behavioral data were gathered through structured interviews with parents. Statistical analyses included t-tests, logistic regression, and machine learning models to predict the risk of ECC.\nRESULTS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 levels were significantly higher in children with ECC (9.25 ± 2.89 ng/mL) compared to caries-free controls (6.41 ± 2.45 ng/mL, p = 0.003), indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Statherin levels, although lower in the ECC group, did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.08). Behavioral factors such as regular dental visits and parental education levels were strongly associated with ECC prevalence. Machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting ECC, with the Gradient Boosting and CatBoost achieving the highest performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 is a promising ECC risk assessment biomarker, while statherin is less effective as an independent predictor.

Achieving near normal blood glucose levels with insulin, a primary goal of diabetes management, carries a significant risk of hypoglycaemia. There is compelling evidence that an abnormal gut microbiota or dysbiosis can increase intestinal permeability (IP) and contribute to dysglycaemia seen in T1D. Given that prebiotic fibre can mitigate dysbiosis, reduce IP and improve glycaemic control, we hypothesise that microbial changes induced by prebiotics contribute to gut and endocrine adaptations that reduce glucose fluctuations, including less hypoglycaemia. In a pilot study, we showed that in children who had T1D for at least 1 year, a 3-month course of prebiotic fibre significantly reduced the frequency of hypoglycaemia. The prebiotic group had an increase in Bifidobacterium with a moderate improvement in IP. Importantly, the prebiotic group maintained their serum C peptide level (marker of residual beta cell function) while the placebo group saw a drop. Given that preserving endogenous beta cell function in patients with T1D, particularly in the first year of diagnosis, reduces hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability, we propose to examine the effect of prebiotic supplementation in patients with T1D.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Individuals (n=144) with T1D will be randomised 1:1 for 6 months to prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin) or placebo (isocaloric maltodextrin). Participants will have three in-person study visits at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The primary outcome, frequency of hypoglycaemia, will be determined from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) reports and patient blood glucose logs. Secondary outcomes will include glycaemic variability, time-in-range, glycated haemoglobin, stimulated C peptide, IP, serum inflammatory markers, quality of life and fear of hypoglycaemia ratings, as well as gut microbiome and metabolomics analysis. At 9 months, participant CGM data will be used to assess frequency of hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability at 3 months postintervention.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical approval from the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (REB21-0852).

Two molecular clusters were identified using \"ConsensusClusterPlus\". With the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, a prognostic signature was built based on cuproptosis. The prognosis, clinical parameters, biological function, immune cell infiltration, therapy sensitivities, and transcription factor regulation of the clusters and risk subsets were further compared. Kaplan Meier curves, time-ROC curves, and nomogram were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the signature. Lastly, qRT-PCR was used to detect prognostic genes in cell lines and clinical samples.\nRESULTS: CRGs exhibited extensive genetic variations and heterogeneous expression profiles in ALL. Single-cell analysis demonstrated that CRGs were strongly correlated with the biological characteristics of cancer cells. Two clusters and risk subgroups with distinct clinicopathological features, prognoses, biological functions, and drug sensitivities were identified. The cuproptosis signature was crucial in characterizing tumor immune landscape and cancer cell self-renewal ability.

As in all radiotherapy, accurate in vivo dosimetry is crucial for quality assurance of safe and efficient treatment delivery. However, this remains a challenge for UHDR as existing dosimetry systems lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to verify dose and dose rate in complex anatomical regions, especially for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy.\nPURPOSE: This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel 3D surface dosimetry method for UHDR PBS proton therapy using high-speed imaging of a scintillator array, coupled with stereovision to provide real-time, high-resolution surface dose monitoring during treatment. The spatial, temporal, and dosimetric components of the proposed system are validated via imaging of a custom QA phantom and are compared against a gafchromic film reading of the same field delivered onto a flat surface.\nMETHODS: A freely deformable multielement scintillator array was designed with a single element pitch of 7.5 mm and interelement gap of 0.5 mm. Scintillation linearity with dose was evaluated along with the variation in scintillator response with increasing imaging and irradiation angles. Water-equivalent thickness (WET) testing was conducted to evaluate beam attenuation at two energy levels. Scintillation emission in response to dose delivery was imaged at 1000 Hz using a high frame rate camera (BeamSite Ultra, DoseOptics LLC) and the array position was monitored via a 2-camera stereovision system. Imaging system setup was validated using a custom 3D QA phantom to assess spatial accuracy and guide systematic setup correction. Stereovision properties of each array element were used to guide angular emission correction, and geometric transformation to beams-eye-view (BEV). Kernel-based residual spot fitting was applied to derive cumulative dose maps which were then compared to the flat film dose profile of a 5 × 5 cm UHDR PBS delivery using 3%/2 mm gamma analysis. PBS and maximum dose rate maps were also calculated.\nRESULTS: System setup achieved an average localization error of 0.62 mm, surpassing the typical 1+ mm threshold used in clinical practice. Intensity correction based on angular information was applied and yielded a cumulative spot dose uncertainty of ∼1% (5.428 mGy). The processed dose map was compared to film via gamma analysis with 3%/2 mm criteria and showed a 99.9% passing rate, indicating high agreement between the planned and measured dose profiles. The WET of the scintillator array was measured to be 1.1 mm, minimizing its impact on dose distribution.\nCONCLUSION: The novel scintillator array system provides accurate, real-time surface dose monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolution, making it a promising tool for in vivo dosimetry in UHDR proton therapy.

Despite ongoing efforts, the management of T2DM remains challenging due to its complex pathogenesis and the limited effectiveness of current treatments. Jinqi Jiangtang Tablets (JQJTT), a well-established Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, have shown promising clinical benefits in regulating blood glucose levels and improving metabolic health in T2DM patients. However, the specific pharmacological mechanisms behind its efficacy are still not fully understood, prompting the need for deeper exploration into its therapeutic actions.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the pharmacologically active ingredients and mechanisms of JQJTT in T2DM using multi-omics methods combined with experimental verification.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified the chemical profile of JQJTT, and targets were screened via SwissTargetPrediction database. T2DM-related targets were acquired from GeneCards and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Therapeutic targets were ascertained by intersecting JQJTT and T2DM targets, followed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment was performed, and the compound-target-pathway network was built using Cytoscape. Mendelian randomization, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), and CIBERSORT analyses were executed to explore immune cell involvement. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified affected cell types, while molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation assessed compound-target affinities. Metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing analyzed JQJTT's effects on metabolites and gut microbiota.\nRESULTS: LC-MS identified 161 compounds in JQJTT. Through network pharmacology, 6 core targets (AKT1, MMP9, HSP90AA1, CASP3, IL-6, PTGS2) were screened, and PI3K/AKT, NFκB, and lipid metabolism were pinpointed as key regulatory pathways. Mendelian randomization linked 39 immune cell types to T2DM, while ssGSEA and CIBERSORT suggested JQJTT potentially modulated the proportion of immune cells. scRNA-seq indicated JQJTT may affect macrophage polarization. Tangeritin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol were determined as the main active compounds with glucose-lowering effects confirmed in vitro. In vivo experiments validated the molecular mechanisms of JQJTT against T2DM. Metabolomics unearthed 56 differentially abundant metabolites, primarily in linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and pyruvaldehyde metabolisms.

Patients aged < 60 years, male sex, absence of right hemicolectomy, postoperative peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≥ 25, and perineural invasion demonstrated significantly lower 1-year and 2-year survival rates compared to their counterparts, with distinct separation observed in the Kaplan-Meier curves. These factors likely reflect biological differences in disease progression, inadequate surgical debulking, and aggressive tumor behavior.\nCONCLUSIONS: a-MiNEN with PMP progresses rapidly.

The pathophysiology of PD is complex and multifactorial involving genetic factors, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein clearance, and neuroinflammation but recent evidence emphasizes the role of impaired brain insulin signaling. Insulin is a metabolic hormone with extensive effects on metabolic substrates but recent studies have demonstrated that it is also involved in central signaling pathways and induces different brain areas related to food craving, motor activities, cognitive abilities, and emotional feelings. Hence it has been suggested that induction of brain insulin sensitivity may be a promising treatment for PD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics are a new-generation class of antidiabetics that normalize glucose homeostasis via several pathways. Recent studies suggest extra-glycemic benefits for GLP-1 mimetics against PD. GLP-1 mimetics can prevent or slow PD progression.

Despite extensive research, the regulatory factors of NF-kB signaling required to preserve homeostasis and control inflammatory disorders are not fully understood. Moreover, the role of MARCH2 in chronic inflammation models and the regulation of MARCH2 activation remain to be elucidated.\nMETHODS: We monitored disease severity and mortality in MARCH2-/- or MARCH2+/+ mice induced experimental colitis. Susceptibility to DSS-induced experimental colitis was determined by various methods, including Swiss roll assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran treatment, respectively. RNA-sequencing was conducted to recognize the inflammatory response-related genes in the distal colon of colitis-induced mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the cytokines and chemokines with in vitro and in vivo samples. Affinity purification and LC-MS/MS analysis were used to identify the MARCH2 interacting proteins and posttranslational modifications. The underlying mechanism was elucidated using immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination assay, and confocal microscopy.\nRESULT: Here, we report that MARCH2-/- mice were more susceptible to experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to the massive production of cytokines. Stimulation by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF induces dimerization of MARCH2 at a later stage and dimerized MARCH2 undergoes K63-linked autoubiquitination at lysine 127 and 238, which promotes NEMO recognition, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We also show an interaction between MARCH2 and MARCH8 in resting cells that inhibits MARCH2 activation. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of MARCH2 and suggest a crucial role of MARCH2 in the modulation of inflammation and cellular homeostasis.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MARCH2 plays a critical role in regulating NEMO/IKKγ under the inflammatory and resting conditions, thereby suppressing excessive or unexpected inflammatory responses.

Various guidelines have formulated key principles, such as fairness, robustness, and explainability, as essential components to achieve trustworthy AI. However, conceptualizations of trustworthy AI often emphasize technical requirements and computational solutions, frequently overlooking broader aspects of fairness and potential biases. These include not only algorithmic bias but also human, institutional, social, and societal factors, which are critical to foster AI systems that are both ethically sound and socially responsible. This viewpoint article presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyzing trust in AI and trustworthy AI within the medical context, focusing on (1) social sciences and humanities conceptualizations and legal perspectives on trust and (2) their implications for trustworthy AI in health care. It focuses on real-world challenges in medicine that are often underrepresented in theoretical discussions to propose a more practice-oriented understanding. Insights were gathered from an interdisciplinary workshop with experts from various disciplines involved in the development and application of medical AI, particularly in oncological imaging and genomics, complemented by theoretical approaches related to trust in AI. Results emphasize that, beyond common issues of bias and fairness, knowledge and human involvement are essential for trustworthy AI. Stakeholder engagement throughout the AI life cycle emerged as crucial, supporting a human- and multicentered framework for trustworthy AI implementation. Findings emphasize that trust in medical AI depends on providing meaningful, user-oriented information and balancing knowledge with acceptable uncertainty. Experts highlighted the importance of confidence in the tool's functionality, specifically that it performs as expected. Trustworthiness was shown to be not a feature but rather a relational process, involving humans, their expertise, and the broader social or institutional contexts in which AI tools operate. Trust is dynamic, shaped by interactions among individuals, technologies, and institutions, and ultimately centers on people rather than tools alone. Tools are evaluated based on reliability and credibility, yet trust fundamentally relies on human connections. The article underscores the development of AI tools that are not only technically sound but also ethically robust and broadly accepted by end users, contributing to more effective and equitable AI-mediated health care. Findings highlight that building AI trustworthiness in health care requires a human-centered, multistakeholder approach with diverse and inclusive engagement.

Currently, several uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods have been proposed and successfully applied in the fields of molecules and proteins, effectively improving model prediction quality and interpretability. Protein-RNA binding represents a fundamental aspect of protein research. Accurate prediction of binding sites and ensuring the reliability of such predictions are crucial for various scientific endeavors. However, many of the existing computational methods have a single feature extraction and lack of UQ. To address these, we propose MGCA (multiscale graph convolutional networks, convolutional neural networks and attention) to better capture local and global information and achieve competitive results in predicting protein-RNA binding sites. Moreover, we launch a UQ study based on MGCA and five prevalent models to verify the robustness of the results. Specifically, we introduce the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess the uncertainty of the models.

Results show that the split-bins screening method reduces false positives (FP), and TS significantly decreases the model ECE.

Statistical analysis was performed from May 2023 to February 2025.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: First, 2 different methods-the validated algorithm and machine learning techniques as the robustness check-were used to identify respondents with probable dementia. Then the status of dementia was used to estimate the association of cohort with dementia status by age-period-cohort methodology.\nRESULTS: Of the 99 420 individuals (mean [SD] age, 79.1 [6.2] years; 59.2% women) in the HRS dataset, 21 069 (21.2%) were included in this study; of the 83 580 individuals (mean [SD] age, 78.6 [5.9] years; 54.7% women) in the SHARE dataset, 32 490 (38.9%) were included in this study; and of the 31 384 individuals (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [5.6] years; 55.8% women) in the ELSA dataset, 8878 (28.3%) were included in this study. Focusing on people aged 71 years or older and controlling for age and period effects, birth cohorts born more recently were less likely to develop dementia in all 3 regions, albeit at different rates (point estimate for 1944-1948 vs 1919-1923 cohorts: US, -0.55 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.34] vs -0.18 [95% CI, -0.25 to -0.10]; Europe, -1.49 [95% CI, -1.72 to -1.27] vs -0.24 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.13]; and England, -0.48 [95% CI, -0.89 to -0.08] vs -0.23 [95% CI, -0.38 to -0.07]). This decreasing trend was more pronounced among women than men (point estimate in 1944-1948 for women vs men: US, -0.55 [95% CI, -0.86 to -0.30] vs -0.48 [95% CI, -0.84 to -0.13]; Europe, -1.50 [95% CI, -1.80 to -1.21] vs -1.34 [95% CI, -1.70 to -0.99]; and England, -0.76 [95% CI, -1.30 to -0.23] vs -0.07 [95% CI, -0.69 to 0.54]); the point estimates for men in England were not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study examining generational differences in age-specific dementia prevalence across the US, Europe, and England, we found that individuals from more recent birth cohorts had lower proportions of people with dementia.

Patients with culture-confirmed TB were identified through electronic health records. Demographic data, cancer history, systemic cancer therapy, and comorbidities were analyzed to assess any association between active TB and previous solid tumors.\nRESULTS: Among 87 patients diagnosed with active TB (incidence rate: 5.1 per 100,000 inhabitants per year), 64.4% were male, with a median age of 48 years (range: 0-85). Only four patients (4.6%) had a history of solid tumor, none of whom had received systemic cancer therapy or radiotherapy prior to active TB diagnosis. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between TB patients with a history of cancer and the general population, and there were no significant associations between gender, country of origin, or systemic cancer therapy.\nCONCLUSION: In this low-incidence TB region, previous medical history of solid tumor among active TB patients is marginal. Solid tumor history does not behave as a strong risk factor for active TB development. In this region, routine latent TB screening in solid cancer patients is not supported by scientific evidence.

However, clinicians, especially junior physicians, often face challenges due to the complexity of describing patient phenotypes accurately. Traditional manual search methods using HPO databases are time-consuming and prone to errors.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate whether the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can improve the accuracy of junior physicians in identifying HPO terms from patient images related to rare diseases.\nMETHODS: In total, 20 junior physicians from 10 specialties participated. Each physician evaluated 27 patient images sourced from publicly available literature, with phenotypes relevant to rare diseases listed in the Chinese Rare Disease Catalogue. The study was divided into 2 groups: the manual search group relied on the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology website, while the MLLM-assisted group used an electronic questionnaire that included HPO terms preidentified by ChatGPT-4o as prompts, followed by a search using the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology. The primary outcome was the accuracy of HPO identification, defined as the proportion of correctly identified HPO terms compared to a standard set determined by an expert panel. Additionally, the accuracy of outputs from ChatGPT-4o and 2 open-source MLLMs (Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b) was evaluated using the same criteria, with hallucinations for each model documented separately. Furthermore, participating physicians completed an additional electronic questionnaire regarding their rare disease background to identify factors affecting their ability to accurately describe patient images using standardized HPO terms.\nRESULTS: A total of 270 descriptions were evaluated per group. The MLLM-assisted group achieved a significantly higher accuracy rate of 67.4% (182/270) compared to 20.4% (55/270) in the manual group (relative risk 3.31, 95% CI 2.58-4.25; P<.001). The MLLM-assisted group demonstrated consistent performance across departments, whereas the manual group exhibited greater variability. Among standalone MLLMs, ChatGPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 48% (13/27), while the open-source models Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b achieved 15% (4/27) and 18% (5/27), respectively. However, MLLMs exhibited a high hallucination rate, frequently generating HPO terms with incorrect IDs or entirely fabricated content.

Primary care physicians provide a significant portion of care, and they often struggle with selecting appropriate medications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a model that accurately predicts what drug an endocrinologist would prescribe based on the current measurements. The goal was to create a system that would assist nonspecialists in choosing medications, thereby potentially improving diabetes treatment outcomes. Based on the performance of previous studies, we set a performance target of achieving a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) above 0.95.\nMETHODS: A transformer-based encoder-decoder model predicts whether 44 types of diabetes drugs will be prescribed. The model uses sequences of age, sex, history for 12 laboratory tests, and prescribed drug history as inputs. We assessed the model using the electronic health records from 7034 patients with diabetes seeing endocrinologists between 2012 and 2022 at the University of Tokyo Hospital. We assessed model performance trained on data subsets spanning different time periods (2, 5, and 10 years) using micro- and macro-averaged ROC-AUC on a hold-out test set comprising data solely from 2022. The model's performance was compared against LightGBM.\nRESULTS: The model trained on data from the past 5 years (2017-2021) yielded the best predictive performance, achieving a microaverage (95% CI) ROC-AUC of 0.993 (0.992-0.994) and a macroaverage (95% CI) ROC-AUC of 0.988 (0.980-0.993). The model achieved an ROC-AUC above 0.95 for 43 out of 44 drugs. These results surpassed the predefined performance target and outperformed both previous studies and the LightGBM model's microaverage ROC-AUC of 0.988 (0.985-0.990) in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, training the model with short-term data from the past 5 years yielded high accuracy compared to using data from the past 10 years, suggesting that learning from more recent prescribing patterns might be advantageous.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting the next prescribed drugs. This model, trained from the past prescriptions of endocrinologists, has the potential to provide information that can assist nonspecialists in making diabetes-treatment decisions. Future studies will focus on incorporating important factors such as prescription contraindications and constraints to enhance safety, as well as leveraging large-scale clinical data across multiple hospitals to improve the generalizability of the model.", "authors": ["Kurasawa Hisashi", "Waki Kayo", "Seki Tomohisa", "Nakahara Eri", "Fujino Akinori", "Shiomi Nagisa", "Nakashima Hiroshi", "Ohe Kazuhiko"], "published_date": "2025-06-02", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "利用Transformer模型強化糖尿病藥物選擇：機器學習模型開發", "summary_zh": "糖尿病影響全球數百萬人，基層醫療醫師在照護上扮演重要角色，但常面臨藥物選擇的困境。本研究開發了一種基於Transformer的機器學習模型，能準確預測內分泌科醫師會開立的糖尿病藥物。該模型使用患者的年齡、性別、實驗室檢驗數據和用藥歷史等資訊進行訓練，並在東京大學醫院的7034名糖尿病患者的電子病歷上進行了驗證。結果顯示，使用過去五年的數據訓練的模型表現最佳，預測準確度超越了先前的研究和LightGBM模型。此模型有潛力協助非專科醫師做出更佳的糖尿病治療決策，未來將納入更多因素，如用藥禁忌和限制，並利用更大規模的臨床數據來提升模型的通用性。", "applications": ["想像一下，如果你的家庭醫生在幫你選擇糖尿病藥物時，有個AI助手可以參考專科醫生的經驗，就像有個虛擬的內分泌科專家在旁邊提供建議，這樣就能更精準地選擇適合你的藥物，減少試錯的時間。", "對於偏遠地區的居民來說，可能很難找到內分泌科醫生。這個AI模型就像一個遠程的專家顧問，可以幫助當地的醫生更好地管理糖尿病患者的用藥，讓他們也能得到和在大城市一樣的專業照護。", "這個模型可以幫助藥廠或醫療機構分析不同藥物組合的效果，找出最佳的用藥方案，從而設計出更有效的糖尿病管理計劃，提升整體治療效果，並可能降低醫療成本。"], "audio": "audios/40456113.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T01:20:43.441561"}

Preclinical learning benefited from AI-powered virtual patients and curriculum design tools that managed expanding medical knowledge and supported robust student practice. Within clinical learning, AI aided diagnostic and interpretive processes, prompting medical education curricula to demand relevant AI competency and literacy frameworks.

Additionally, the hyperparameters of these distributions are typically determined empirically, which may not accurately reflect the true distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a disease grading network utilizing a sample-aware asymmetric Gaussian label distribution, termed DGN-AGLD. This approach includes a variance predictor designed to learn and predict parameters that control the asymmetry of the Gaussian distribution, enabling distinct label distributions within the same category.

The growing number of individuals seeking help, coupled with the limited resources of clinics, highlights the critical need to identify factors that can predict treatment efficacy. Machine learning (ML) techniques hold great promise in this regard. This data-driven approach offers an unbiased means to uncover predictors of specific outcomes, advancing the understanding and management of this challenging condition.\nOBJECTIVE: Six supervised ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree and Random Forest) were applied to develop a binary classification model predicting short-term weight recovery/stabilization in AN inpatients and identify the most critical factors influencing this outcome.\nMETHODS: Change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from admission to discharge (ΔBMI) was used as the outcome, allowing to classify patients into \"improved\" (BMI stability or increase) and \"aggravation\" (BMI decrease). Predictors included clinically relevant psychological tests and physical parameters.

K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical.\nMETHODS: We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans.\nRESULTS: We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32, 22, and 12 dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24, 14, and 4 dB for fat-suppressed knee data.\nCONCLUSION: We showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions.

However, none of the available data have provided comprehensive estimates and projections at both regional and national levels in diabetes prevention and management. This study aimed to explore the temporal trends and geographical variations in the prevalence and non-fatal burden of diabetes by age and sex across China from 2005 to 2023, and to forecast diabetes prevalence through 2050.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based study based on the nationally representative surveys, and literature reviews. Using the DisMod-MR model and Chinese-specific disease disability weights, we estimated the non-fatal burdens of diabetes, including prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs), across sexes, age groups, and locations. The temporal trend change was measured as the average annual percent change. The effect of the Human Development Index on burdens was assessed by applying Spearman's rank correlation analysis. We further projected diabetes prevalence to 2050 under two scenarios, the natural trend and the effective intervention on body mass index (BMI).\nRESULTS: In 2023, an estimated 233 million individuals in China were living with diabetes. Compared to 2005, the age-standardized rate (ASR) of prevalence has increased by nearly 50%, from 7.53% (95% CI 7.00-8.10%) to 13.7% (95% CI 12.6-14.8%) in 2023. The ASR of YLDs was estimated at 19.1 per 1000 population (95% CI 18.6-19.5) in 2023, compared to 10.5 per 1000 population in 2005. The ASR of prevalence and YLDs was consistently higher in males than in females. The provinces with the highest diabetes prevalence and disease burden were Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Our forecast results suggest that if existing trends continue, the prevalence of obesity will reach 29.1% (95% CI 22.2-38.2%) nationally by 2050, with some provinces in the northern region observing a prevalence of over 40%.

However, the solid electrolyte interphase that is derived from the electrolyte easily hinders the diffusion and nucleation of Li+, which ultimately suppresses N2 activation and the subsequent protonation process. Herein, we successfully construct surface oxygen vacancies (Ov) on commercial BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles and further drive the phase transition from cubic/tetragonal to rhombohedral, which enhances the ferroelectricity of Ov-enriched BaTiO3 (BTOV) and produces orderly arranged dipoles. Systematic experimental and computational results validate that Ov-induced orderly arranged dipoles readily bind anions in the electrolyte and promote their reduction to form a LiF-rich SEI. The optimized anion-derived SEI enhances the Li+ transfer kinetics and effectively facilitates the uniform nucleation of Li+, which enables lower energy of Li+ desolvation and the reactant crossing the SEI. Thus, the as-prepared BTOV delivers a faradaic efficiency of 93.01% and an NH3 yield rate of 6.94 nmol s-1 cm-2 at -0.5 V which achieves more than a 45-fold performance improvement compared to the BTO counterpart.

Despite the rising global incidence of SLE, its aetiology remains unclear. We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR), multi-omics integration, machine learning (ML), and SHAP to identify key metabolites and genes associated with SLE, revealing the crucial role of the glutathione pathway. MR analysis was performed on 1400 serum metabolites, revealing significant enrichment in the glutathione metabolic pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data classified monocytes into Metabolism_high and Metabolism_low groups based on glutathione metabolism scores. Differentially expressed genes were analysed using GSEA, metabolic pathway activity assessment, transcription factor prediction, cellular communication analysis, and Pseudotime analysis. LASSO regression identified hub genes and machine learning models (CatBoost, XGBoost, NGBoost) were developed. The SHAP method was used to interpret these models. Expression of key genes was validated across multiple datasets. MR analysis confirmed that metabolites were enriched in the glutathione pathway, identifying nine hub genes. Machine learning models achieved AUCs of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.83 in the validation set. SHAP analysis highlighted LAP3 as the top contributing gene across all models. scRNA-seq data showed that LAP3 plays a significant role in the immune microenvironment of SLE.

Amblyopic subjects were classified as those without nystagmus (n = 42) and those with nystagmus with fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) or nystagmus that did not meet the criteria of FMN or infantile nystagmus syndrome (n = 53). A multihead attention-based transformer encoder model was trained and cross-validated on deblinked and denoised eye position data acquired during fixation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of amblyopia across types (anisometropia, strabismus, or mixed) and severity (treated, mild, moderate, or severe) and subjects with and without nystagmus was evaluated with area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and accuracy.\nRESULTS: Area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves for classification of subjects per type were 0.70 ± 0.16 for anisometropia (AUPRC: 0.72 ± 0.08), 0.78 ± 0.15 for strabismus (AUPRC: 0.81 ± 0.16), and 0.80 ± 0.13 for mixed (AUPRC: 0.82 ± 0.15). Area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves for classification of amblyopia subjects per severity were 0.77 ± 0.12 for treated/mild (AUPRC: 0.76 ± 0.18), and 0.78 ± 0.09 for moderate/severe (AUPRC: 0.79 ± 0.16).

Conventional symptom tracking methods rely on self-reports and clinical visits, which can be infrequent, subjective, and burdensome. Digital phenotyping using passively collected sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers offers a promising alternative for continuous, real-time symptom monitoring with minimal patient burden.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based digital phenotyping approach to monitor the severity of clinically-relevant MS symptoms. We used passive sensing data to predict short-term fluctuations in patient-reported symptoms, including depressive symptoms, global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality. Further, we examined the impact of incorporating behavioral context features and ecological momentary assessments on prediction performance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a 12- to 24-week longitudinal study involving 104 people with MS, collecting passive sensor and behavioral health data. Smartphone sensors recorded call activity, location, and screen use, while fitness trackers captured heart rate, sleep patterns, and step count. We extracted patient-level behavioral features and categorized them into 2 feature sets: one from the prediction period (called action) and one from the preceding period (called context). Using an ML pipeline based on support vector machines and AdaBoost, we evaluated the predictive performance of sensor-based models, both with and without ecological momentary assessment inputs.\nRESULTS: Between November 16, 2019, and January 24, 2021, overall, 104 people with MS (women: n=88, 84.6%; non-Hispanic White: n=97, 93.3%; mean age 44, SD 11.8 years) from a clinic-based cohort completed 12 weeks of data collection, including a subset of 44 participants (women: n=39, 89%; non-Hispanic White: n=42, 95%; mean age 45.7, SD 11.2 years) who completed 24 weeks of data collection. In total, we collected approximately 12,500 days of passive sensor and behavioral health data from the participants. Among the best-performing models with the least sensor data requirement, the ML algorithm predicted depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 80.6% (F1-score=0.76), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 77.3% (F1-score=0.78), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 73.8% (F1-score=0.74), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 72.0% (F1-score=0.70). Further, sensor data were largely sufficient for predicting symptom severity, while the prediction of depressive symptoms benefited from minimal active patient input in the form of responses to 2 brief questions on the day before the prediction point.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our digital phenotyping approach using passive sensors on smartphones and fitness trackers may help patients with real-world, continuous self-monitoring of common symptoms in their own environment and assist clinicians with better triage of patient needs for timely interventions in MS and potentially other chronic neurological disorders.", "authors": ["Xia Zongqi", "Chikersal Prerna", "Venkatesh Shruthi", "Walker Elizabeth", "Dey Anind K", "Goel Mayank"], "published_date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "利用被動感測行為與生態瞬時評估進行多發性硬化症嚴重程度的縱向數位表型分析：真實世界評估", "summary_zh": "這項研究利用智慧型手機和健身追蹤器的感測器數據，開發了一種數位表型方法，來監測多發性硬化症(MS)患者的症狀嚴重程度。研究追蹤了104位MS患者長達12到24週，收集他們的通話紀錄、定位、螢幕使用時間、心率、睡眠模式和步數等數據。透過機器學習演算法，研究成功預測了憂鬱症狀、整體MS症狀負擔、嚴重疲勞和不良睡眠品質等症狀的短期波動，準確率最高可達80.6%。研究結果表明，這種數位表型方法有助於MS患者在日常生活中持續自我監測症狀，並協助臨床醫生及時介入治療，改善患者的生活品質。", "applications": ["想像一下，未來多發性硬化症患者只要戴著智慧手錶或帶著手機，就能自動追蹤自己的疲勞程度、睡眠品質等等。如果數據顯示狀況不好，系統就會提醒他該休息或尋求醫療協助，就像一個隨時在身邊關心你的健康小幫手。", "這項技術也能幫助醫生更了解病人的狀況。醫生不用只靠病人自己回憶，而是能看到客觀的數據，例如病人的活動量、睡眠時間等等，就能更準確地判斷病情，給予更個人化的治療建議。", "藥廠或研究機構可以利用這些數據，更快速、更有效地評估新的治療方法對多發性硬化症患者的影響。例如，他們可以觀察使用新藥後，病人的活動量、睡眠品質是否有改善，從而判斷藥物的療效。"], "audio": "audios/40459924.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T18:24:02.191187"}

Machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, are promising in this regard. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data can lead to model drift, where the model's performance degrades over time, as the underlying data distribution changes due to evolving disease characteristics, demographic shifts, and variations in recording conditions. Addressing this challenge is crucial to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of these models in ongoing diagnostic applications.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework that not only monitors model drift over time but also uses adaptation mechanisms to mitigate performance fluctuations in COVID-19 detection models trained on dynamic cough audio data.\nMETHODS: Two crowdsourced COVID-19 audio datasets, namely COVID-19 Sounds and Coswara, were used for development and evaluation purposes. Each dataset was divided into 2 distinct periods, namely the development period and postdevelopment period. A baseline convolutional neural network model was initially trained and evaluated using data (ie, coughs from COVID-19 Sounds and shallow coughs from Coswara dataset) from the development period. To detect changes in data distributions and the model's performance between these periods, the maximum mean discrepancy distance was used. Upon detecting significant drift, a retraining procedure was triggered to update the baseline model. The study explored 2 model adaptation approaches, unsupervised domain adaptation and active learning, both of which were comparatively assessed.\nRESULTS: The baseline model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 69.13% and a balanced accuracy of 63.38% on the development test set of the COVID-19 Sounds dataset, while for the Coswara dataset, the corresponding values were 66.8% and 61.64%. A decline in performance was observed when the model was evaluated on data from the postdevelopment period, indicating the presence of model drift. The application of the unsupervised domain adaptation approach led to performance improvement in terms of balanced accuracy by up to 22% and 24% for the COVID-19 Sounds and Coswara datasets, respectively. The active learning approach yielded even greater improvement, corresponding to a balanced accuracy increase of up to 30% and 60% for the 2 datasets, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of model drift in COVID-19 detection by enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data distributions.

Advances in spatial proteomics have shown that automatic recognition of protein subcellular localization from images could highly facilitate protein translocation analysis and biomarker discovery, but existing machine learning works have been mostly limited to processing 2D images. By contrast, 3D images have higher spatial resolution and allow researchers to observe cellular structures in their natural context, but currently there are only a few studies of 3D image processing for protein distribution analysis due to the lack of data and complexity of modeling.\nRESULTS: We develop a knowledge-enhanced protein subcellular localization model, KE3DLoc, which could recognize distribution patterns in 3D fluorescence microscope images using deep learning methods. The model designs an image feature extraction module that incorporates information from 3D and 2D projected cells, and implements an asymmetric loss and confidence weights to a data imbalance and weak cell annotation issues. Besides, considering that the biological knowledge in the Gene Ontology (GO) database can provide valuable support for protein location understanding, the KE3DLoc model incorporates a novel knowledge enhancement module that optimizes the protein representation by related knowledge graphs derived from the GO. Since the image module and the knowledge module calculate features from different levels, KE3DLoc designs protein ID aggregation to enhance the consistency of protein features across different cells.

Overcoming MDR to achieve effective cancer treatment remains a huge challenge. Here, we proposed a self-generative singlet oxygen (1O2)-initiated chemical modification of nuclear DNAs (SiCMoND) approach to kill multidrug-resistant tumor synergizing with chemotherapy. A tumor-targeted \"nano-bomb\" FA(CT-fT-Dox) was rationally fabricated by encapsulating the complex of Cu2+ with tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) (Cu-TCPP) as a 1O2 generator and a doxorubicin (Dox) prodrug tailed with a furan-containing positively charged peptide (fTAT-Dox) within the micelles of FA-PEG5000-PCL3000 and mPEG5000-PCL3000. When FA(CT-fT-Dox) nanoparticles accumulated at the tumor site, they could undergo disassembly in the tumor microenvironment (TME) specifically to release Cu-TCPP and fTAT-Dox simultaneously. Taking advantage of the features of Cu-TCPP that can convert tumor-abundant H2O2 into 1O2 and fTAT-Dox that can readily penetrate the cell membrane into the nucleus, chemical modification of nuclear DNAs was realized through the covalent cyclization reaction between furan and nucleobases of nuclear DNAs under the ignition of self-generative 1O2, which leads to significant DNA damage and enhanced therapeutic susceptibility.

While comorbid depression and health insurance disparities are individually known to potentiate this risk, technological devices for T1DM appear to be protective.\nOBJECTIVE: We examined whether technology use impacted the association between depression and poorer health outcomes in T1DM. Given established insurance-based disparities based on technology access, we also studied whether the protective effects of T1DM technology differed among publicly and privately insured youth.\nMETHODS: Data were prospectively collected from pediatric patients with T1DM across 3 California medical centers. We used linear and negative binomial regression analyses to examine whether technology use was related to diabetes outcomes and whether this differed based on depression status (technology-by-depression interaction) and health insurance type (technology-by-insurance interaction).\nRESULTS: Across 1573 patients aged 12 to 25 years (mean age 15.9, SD 2.9 years; n=1050, 66.4%, non-Hispanic White; n=745, 47.0% female), those with a depression diagnosis had higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; mean 9.1%, SD 2.1% vs 10.1%, SD 2.2%) and more frequent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events per year (mean 0.10, SD 0.36 vs 0.24, SD 0.66) than those without (P=.003).

However, current prediction models often rely on structured data and overlook the nuanced clinical reasoning embedded in free-text preoperative notes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened opportunities for harnessing unstructured clinical data, yet their application in perioperative prediction remains limited by concerns about factual accuracy. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution-enhancing LLM performance by grounding outputs in domain-specific knowledge sources, potentially improving both predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether integrating LLMs with RAG can improve the prediction of 30-day postoperative mortality and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification using unstructured preoperative clinical notes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 24,491 medical records from a tertiary medical center, including preoperative anesthesia assessments, discharge summaries, and surgical information. To extract clinical insights from free-text data, we used the LLaMA 3.1-8B language model with RAG, using MedEmbed for text embedding and Miller's Anesthesia as the primary retrieval source. We evaluated model performance under various configurations, including embedding models, chunk sizes, and few-shot prompting. Machine learning (ML) models, including random forest, support vector machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression, were trained on structured features as baselines.\nRESULTS: A total of 520 (2.1%) patients experienced in-hospital 30-day postoperative mortality. The ASA physical status distribution was as follows: class I: 535 (2.2%); class II: 15,272 (62.4%); class III: 8024 (32.8%); class IV: 606 (2.5%); and class V: 54 (0.22%). For 30-day postoperative mortality prediction, the LLaMA‑RAG model achieved an F1-score of 0.4663 (95% CI 0.4654-0.4672), versus 0.2369 (95% CI 0.2341-0.2397) without few‑shot prompting, 0.0879 (95% CI 0.0717-0.1041) without RAG, and 0.0436 (95% CI 0.0292-0.0580) without either few‑shot prompting or RAG.

Similar to the systemic lymphatic system, the glymphatic system plays a critical role in immune responses and has been implicated not only in Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory brain disorders but also in conditions such as hydrocephalus and glaucoma, which are associated with cerebrospinal fluid circulation impairments. Recent studies have suggested that dysfunction of the glymphatic system may promote the progression of brain tumors and reduce the efficacy of immune responses and pharmacological therapies targeting tumors. Radiotherapy is a major treatment option for brain tumors; however, while it can enhance immune responses against tumors, it may also suppress these responses at the same time. Additionally, cranial irradiation has been suggested to impair the function of the glymphatic system. This review provides an overview of the structure and functional evaluation methods of the glymphatic system, summarizes the effects of its dysfunction on brain tumor treatment, and explores recent findings on the impact of radiation therapy on glymphatic system functioning.

Natural products are considered potential candidates for the management of DM. Crocin, a natural carotenoid derived from saffron, has been reported to possess several pharmacological properties, including cardioprotective effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effects of crocin on the metabolic derangement of the diabetic myocardium. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated with 10 mg/kg of crocin daily for two weeks. Oral administration of crocin normalized blood glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels. Notably, crocin reduced the elevated protein levels of cardiac PPARα and PPARδ-major transcriptional regulators of cardiac metabolism-back to normal. Consequently, the expression of the fatty acid (FA) transporter CD36 was downregulated, the activity of the FA oxidation enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was decreased, and intramyocardial triglyceride accumulation returned to physiological levels. Furthermore, crocin improved glucose uptake and metabolism in the diabetic myocardium, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, enhanced activity of pyruvate kinase, and downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of crocin on Akt phosphorylation was also confirmed in isolated cardiac myocytes exposed to high glucose, further supporting its direct role in modulating glucose signaling pathways. Crocin treatment also reduced STZ-induced elevations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-as well as the phosphorylation of IκBα, bringing them close to basal levels. Overall, these findings suggest that crocin activates Akt signaling and thereby alleviates diabetes-induced metabolic disturbances by restoring the balance between glucose and fatty acid utilization in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic rats.

MDRDEGs were linked to AGE-RAGE signaling, RNA processing, protein transport, and energy metabolism using functional enrichment analysis. Seven MDRDEGs with significant genetic causal effects in DKD were discovered using SMR and MR analyses: ACTN1, ALG11, CCNB1, HIVEP2, MANBA, TUBA1A, and WFS1. Co-localization and scRNA-seq analyses examined these genes' DKD connections. Due to the high significance of its prediction model and DKD expression, ACTN1 was studied in depth.

The lack of effective antiviral drugs necessitates a robust therapeutic approach to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Various investigations have recognized ACE2 as the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and this amalgamation of ACE2 with the spike protein of the coronavirus is paramount for viral entry into the host cells and inducing infection. Consequently, restricting the virus's accessibility to ACE2 offers an alternative therapeutic approach to averting this illness.\nOBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify potent inhibitors with enhanced affinity for the ACE2 protein and validate their stability and efficacy against established inhibitors via molecular docking, machine learning, and MD simulations.\nMETHODOLOGY: 202 ACE2 inhibitors (PDB ID and 6LZG), comprising repurposed antiviral compounds and specific ACE2 inhibitors, were selected for molecular docking. The two most effective compounds obtained from docking were further analyzed using machine learning to identify potential compounds with enhanced ACE2-binding affinity. To refine the dataset, molecular decoys were generated through the Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E) server, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was applied for data preprocessing. The Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was then utilized to optimize the machine learning pipeline. The most promising ML-predicted compounds were re-evaluated through docking and subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate their structural stability and interactions with ACE2. Finally, these compounds were evaluated against the top two pre-established inhibitors using various computational tools.\nRESULTS: The two best pre-established inhibitors were identified as Birinapant and Elbasvir, while the best machine-learning-predicted compounds were PubChem ID: 23658468 and PubChem ID: 117637105. Pharmacophore studies were conducted on the most effective machine-learning-predicted compounds, followed by a comparative ADME/T analysis between the best ML-screened and pre-established inhibitors. The results indicated that the top ML compound (PubChem ID: 23658468) demonstrated favorable BBB permeability and a high HIA index, highlighting its potential for therapeutic applications. The ML-screened ligand demonstrated structural stability with an RMSD (0.24 nm) and greater global stability (Rg: 2.08 nm) than Birinapant. Hydrogen bonding interactions further validated their strong binding affinity. MM/PBSA analysis confirmed the ML-screened compound's stronger binding affinity, with a binding free energy of - 132.90 kcal/mol, indicating enhanced stability in complex formation.\nCONCLUSION: The results emphasize the efficacy of integrating molecular docking, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations in facilitating the rapid identification of novel inhibitors.

ADT can induce body composition change; however, the association between body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between ADT-induced body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included 681 patients with prostate cancer (410 in the derivation cohort and 271 in the external validation cohort) who underwent radiotherapy and ADT between 2008 and 2021. Computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline and 6 months post-ADT were used to assess the changes in skeletal muscle index (ΔSMI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (ΔSATI) and visceral adipose tissue index (ΔVATI) at the L3 vertebral level. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, arterial revascularization and cardiovascular death. The association between body composition changes and MACE was analysed using the SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) method and validated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: The median age was 72 years (interquartile range: 66-77). With a median follow-up of 6.0 years (derivation cohort) and 6.6 years (validation cohort), 62 (15.1%) and 39 (14.4%) patients experienced MACE, respectively. Six months post-ADT, there was a reduction in SMI, whereas SATI and VATI had increased (p < 0.001). The ΔSMI and ΔSATI were the most important features for predicting MACE in both cohorts, whereas ΔVATI and baseline body composition parameters were less influential. SMI loss was inversely correlated with MACE risk, whereas increases in SATI and VATI were positively correlated. The identified thresholds for MACE prediction were SMI loss ≥ 4.7% and SATI gain ≥ 8.2%. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, ΔSMI (hazard ratio: 1.27 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001) and ΔSATI (hazard ratio: 1.07 per 1% increase, p < 0.001) were independently associated with MACE risk; however, ΔVATI was not (hazard ratio: 0.99, p = 0.23).

While no cure exists, early diagnosis can significantly slow disease progression. Computer-aided diagnostic systems are becoming critical tools for assisting in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate recent advancements in computer-aided decision support systems for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, focusing on data modalities, machine learning methods, and performance metrics.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published between 2021 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, IEEEXplore and Web of Science, using search terms related to Alzheimer's disease classification, neuroimaging, machine learning, and diagnostic performance. A total of 39 studies met the inclusion criteria, focusing on the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease classification using machine learning models.\nRESULTS: Multimodal approaches, combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography and Cognitive assessments, outperformed single-modality studies in diagnostic accuracy reliability. Convolutional Neural Networks were the most commonly used machine learning models, followed by hybrid models and Random Forest. The highest accuracy reported for binary classification was 100%, while multi-class classification achieved up to 99.98%. Techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and data augmentation were frequently employed to address data imbalance, improving model generalizability.\nDISCUSSION: Our review highlights the advantages of using multimodal data in computer-aided decision support systems for more accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, we also identified several limitations, including data imbalance, small sample sizes, and the lack of external validation in most studies.

However, modeling EHR sequential data, that is, patient trajectories, is challenging due to the evolving relationships between diagnoses and treatments over time. Significant progress has been achieved using transformers and self-supervised learning. While BERT-inspired models using masked language modeling (MLM) capture EHR context, they often struggle with the complex temporal dynamics of disease progression and interventions.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the modeling of EHR sequences by addressing the limitations of traditional transformer-based approaches in capturing complex temporal dependencies.\nMETHODS: We introduce Trajectory Order Objective BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; TOO-BERT), a transformer-based model that advances the MLM pretraining approach by integrating a novel TOO to better learn the complex sequential dependencies between medical events. TOO-Bert enhanced the learned context by MLM by pretraining the model to distinguish ordered sequences of medical codes from permuted ones in a patient trajectory. The TOO is enhanced by a conditional selection process that focus on medical codes or visits that frequently occur together, to further improve contextual understanding and strengthen temporal awareness. We evaluate TOO-BERT on 2 extensive EHR datasets, MIMIC-IV hospitalization records and the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort (MDC)-comprising approximately 10 and 8 million medical codes, respectively. TOO-BERT is compared against conventional machine learning methods, a transformer trained from scratch, and a transformer pretrained on MLM in predicting heart failure (HF), Alzheimer disease (AD), and prolonged length of stay (PLS).\nRESULTS: TOO-BERT outperformed conventional machine learning methods and transformer-based approaches in HF, AD, and PLS prediction across both datasets. In the MDC dataset, TOO-BERT improved HF and AD prediction, increasing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores from 67.7 and 69.5 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 73.9 and 71.9, respectively. In the MIMIC-IV dataset, TOO-BERT enhanced HF and PLS prediction, raising AUC scores from 86.2 and 60.2 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 89.8 and 60.4, respectively. Notably, TOO-BERT demonstrated strong performance in HF prediction even with limited fine-tuning data, achieving AUC scores of 0.877 and 0.823, compared to 0.839 and 0.799 for the MLM-pretrained Transformer, when fine-tuned on only 50% (442/884) and 20% (176/884) of the training data, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating temporal ordering objectives into MLM-pretrained models, enabling deeper insights into the complex temporal relationships inherent in EHR data.

The venom of wasps contains a variety of bioactive compounds that can lead to a wide range of clinical effects, from mild localized pain and swelling to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in health care, including emergency medicine and toxicology. These models have the potential to assist health care professionals in making fast and informed clinical decisions. This study aimed to assess the performance of 4 leading LLMs-ERNIE Bot 3.5 (Baidu), ERNIE Bot 4.0 (Baidu), Claude Pro (Anthropic), and ChatGPT 4.0-in managing wasp sting cases, with a focus on their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and decision-making abilities.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to systematically evaluate and compare the capabilities of the 4 LLMs in the context of wasp sting management. This involved analyzing their responses to a series of standardized questions and real-world clinical scenarios. The study aimed to determine which LLMs provided the most accurate, complete, and clinically relevant information for the management of wasp stings.\nMETHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design, creating 50 standardized questions that covered 10 key domains in the management of wasp stings, along with 20 real-world clinical case scenarios. Responses from the 4 LLMs were independently evaluated by 8 domain experts, who rated them on a 5-point Likert scale based on accuracy, completeness, and usefulness in clinical decision-making. Statistical comparisons between the models were made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the consistency of expert ratings was assessed using the Kendall coefficient of concordance.\nRESULTS: Claude Pro achieved the highest average score of 4.7 (SD 0.603) out of 5, followed closely by ChatGPT 4.0 with a score of 4.5. ERNIE Bot 4.0 and ERNIE Bot 3.5 received average scores of 4 (SD 0.600) and 3.8, respectively. In analyzing the 20 complex clinical cases, Claude Pro significantly outperformed ERNIE Bot 3.5, particularly in areas such as managing complications and assessing the severity of reactions (P<.001). The expert ratings showed moderate agreement (Kendall W=0.67), indicating that the assessments were consistently reliable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that Claude Pro and ChatGPT 4.0 are highly capable of providing accurate and comprehensive support for the clinical management of wasp stings, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios.

AF can increase the risk of stroke and other serious cardiovascular complications, compromising patients' quality of life and survival. Screening of AF, both asymptomatic and symptomatic forms, is therefore essential for optimal management.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the Watch Your Heart After Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer (WATCH) study is to assess the incidence of AF (symptomatic or asymptomatic) occurring throughout a 5-year follow-up after RT and to investigate whether cardiac radiation exposure is associated with the occurrence of such events.\nMETHODS: WATCH is a cohort study that will include 200 patients over 65 years old, treated with RT for BC 5 years before inclusion and without a history of AF. Cross-sectional screening for AF at the time of the scheduled 5-year post-RT visit will be conducted by recording data from a Withings ScanWatch smartwatch for 1 month, confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG), and validated by a physician. In addition, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be performed, providing a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structures, and allowing us to investigate the underlying etiology and assess the risk of complications. Patients' medical records will provide retrospective information about the timing and risk factors for the occurrence of AF and other arrhythmias and cardiac diseases during the 5 years following RT. The development of deep learning algorithms for autosegmentation analysis of potentially critical substructures for the occurrence of AF, including cardiac chambers, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, coronary arteries, and pulmonary veins (PVs), will produce dosimetry linked to previous RT treatment for all contoured structures.\nRESULTS: Enrollment started in October 2023 and will continue until mid-2026 to include 200 patients, which will ensure an 80% statistical power to detect a significant difference in AF incidence around 15% for the group of patients moderately exposed (<75th percentile of the mean heart radiation dose) and 25% for the group of patients highly exposed (>75th percentile of the mean heart radiation dose). The results are expected by the end of 2026.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to generating new knowledge on AF after RT for BC and help considering the inclusion of AF screening into routine clinical practice for these patients.

The rising prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) highlights the need for more comprehensive treatment strategies, with a particular emphasis on supporting maternal self-management. We showed recently that a mobile app, eMOM, where glucose, nutrition, and physical activity are combined within a single app, significantly improves multiple clinical outcomes among persons with gestational diabetes.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effects of the eMOM on maternal self-discovery and learning, autonomous motivation to manage GDM, and psychological well-being. Additionally, we examine the correlation between improved maternal clinical outcomes and change in autonomous motivation. We also assess the acceptance and usability of the eMOM app.\nMETHODS: Building upon the original randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which the intervention arm used a mobile app (eMOM), we conducted a mixed methods study that included an investigation of eMOM log files, semistructured interviews on self-discovery, and an examination of questionnaires assessing motivation (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire and Perceived Competence Scale), depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), technology use and acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology questionnaire), and usability (modified Software Usability Measurement Inventory). Additionally, we monitored participants' stress levels using wearable electrocardiographic devices (FirstBeat Bodyguard 2). A total of 148 individuals participated in the original RCTs, with 76 in the intervention arm and 72 in the control arm. From the intervention arm, 18 participants were randomly selected for interviews in this study.\nRESULTS: Results show that the use rate of eMOM was high, and novel visualization supported self-discovery in persons with GDM. Most participants (17/18, 94%) indicated that the eMOM app helped to find the associations between their daily activities and glucose levels. Especially having nutrition visualized together with glucose was highly appreciated. Participants also reported learning about the associations between physical activity and glucose levels. No differences were observed between the intervention and control arms in autonomous motivation, depression, or stress. Furthermore, there were no correlations between improved clinical outcomes and changes in motivation. Accessibility and usability ratings were consistently high throughout the intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: The eMOM mobile app combining data from continuous glucose monitor, food diary, and physical activity tracker supports maternal self-discovery related to GDM without contributing to depression or adding extra stress.

Traditional scheduling methods often fail to consider individual preferences, leading to dissatisfaction, burnout, and high turnover. Inadequate scheduling practices, including restricted autonomy and lack of transparency, can further reduce nurse morale and negatively affect patient outcomes. Research suggests that participative scheduling approaches incorporating nurse preferences can improve job satisfaction. Artificial intelligence (AI) and mathematical optimization methods, such as mixed-integer programming (MIP), constraint programming (CP), genetic programming (GP), and reinforcement learning (RL), offer potential solutions to optimize scheduling and address these challenges.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a framework for integrating nurses' preferences into AI-supported scheduling methods by gathering qualitative insights from nurses and supervisors and mapping these to mathematical and AI-based scheduling techniques.\nMETHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted with 21 participants (nurses, supervisors, and temporary staff) from Swiss health care institutions to understand experiences and preferences related to staff scheduling. Qualitative data were analyzed using open and axial coding to extract key themes. These themes were then mapped to AI methodologies, including MIP, CP, GP, and RL, based on their suitability to address identified scheduling challenges.\nRESULTS: The study revealed key priorities in nurse scheduling. Fairness and participation were highlighted by 85% (18/21) of interview participants, emphasizing the need for transparent and inclusive scheduling. Flexibility and autonomy were preferred by 76% (16/21), favoring shift swaps and self-scheduling. AI expectations were mixed: 62% (13/21) saw potential for improved efficiency and fairness, while 38% (8/21) expressed concerns over reliability and loss of human oversight. Mapping to AI methods showed MIP as effective for fair shift allocation, CP for complex rule-based conditions, GP for handling unforeseen absences, and RL for dynamic schedule adaptation in hospital environments. A preliminary AI implementation of MIP in a training hospital unit (35 staff members) showed how to design a system from a mathematical perspective.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-supported scheduling systems can significantly enhance fairness, transparency, and efficiency in nurse scheduling. However, concerns regarding AI reliability, adaptability to individual needs, and human oversight must be addressed. A hybrid approach integrating AI recommendations with human decision-making may be optimal.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are utilized to measure patient core musculature as a measurement of sarcopenia. Methods to extract information on core body musculature can be through either freehand region-of-interest (ROI) or machine learning algorithms to quantitate total body muscle within a given area. This study directly compares these two collection methods leveraging length of stay (LOS) outcomes previously found to be associated with freehand ROI measurements.\nMETHODS: A total of 50 individuals were included who underwent liver transplantation from our single center between January 1, 2016, and May 30, 2021, and had a non-contrast abdominal CT scan within 6-months of surgery. CT-derived skeletal muscle measures at the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained using freehand ROI and an automated deep learning system.\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis of freehand psoas muscle measures, psoas area index (PAI) and mean Hounsfield units (mHU), were significantly correlated to the automated deep learning system's total skeletal muscle measures at the level of the L3, skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD), respectively (R2 = 0.4221; p value < 0.0001; R2 = 0.6297; p value < 0.0001). The automated deep learning model's SMI predicted ∼20% of the variability (R2 = 0.2013; hospital length of stay) while the PAI variable only predicted about 10% of the variability (R2 = 0.0919; total healthcare length of stay) of the length of stay variables. In contrast, both the freehand ROI mHU and the automated deep learning model's muscle density variables were associated with ∼20% of the variability in the inpatient length of stay (R2 = 0.2383 and 0.1810, respectively) and total healthcare length of stay variables (R2 = 0.2190 and 0.1947, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Sarcopenia measurements represent an important risk stratification tool for liver transplantation outcomes.

It is the major cause of chronic kidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney replacement therapy.\nMAIN BODY: In DKD, numerous dysbalanced metabolic, haemodynamic, inflammatory signalling pathways, and molecular mediators interconnect, creating a feedback loop that promotes general kidney damage. Hyperglycaemia is the primary trigger for DKD and leads gradually to oxidative stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis, glomerular hypertension, and intrarenal hypoxia. Key interconnected metabolic pathways are the hyperglycaemia-mediated polyol, hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation end-products pathway hyperactivity. Concurrently, hyperglycaemia-induced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation, alters the kidney intraglomerular haemodynamic leading to inflammation through Toll-like receptors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor-beta-mediated excessive extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. The resulting death signals trigger apoptosis and autophagy through Hippo, Notch, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and microRNA dysregulation. These signals synergistically remodel the kidneys culminating in intrarenal hypoxia, podocyte dysfunction, hyperfiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and loss of kidney function. The resulting renal failure further upregulates these death pathways and mediators, giving rise to a vicious cycle that further worsens DKD.\nCONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the primary molecular mediators and signalling pathways leading to DKD; their interconnectivity at the onset and during DKD progression, the central role of transforming growth factor-beta via different pathways, the Hippo pathway kidney-specific response to hyperglycaemia, and how all mediators and transduction signals result in a vicious circle that exacerbates renal failure. The review gives therapeutic sights to these pathways as druggable targets for DKD management.

Imaging studies have yielded varied results, and it is now clear that there is unlikely to be one characteristic neuroanatomical profile of either condition. Parsing this heterogeneity could allow us to identify more homogeneous subgroups, either within or across conditions, which may be more clinically informative. This has been a pivotal goal for neurodevelopmental research using both clinical and neuroanatomical features, though results thus far have again been inconsistent with regards to the number and characteristics of subgroups.\nMETHODS: Here, we use population modelling to cluster a multi-site dataset based on global and regional centile scores of cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume. We use HYDRA, a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which clusters based on differences to controls and compare its performance to a traditional clustering approach.\nRESULTS: We identified distinct subgroups within autism and ADHD, as well as across diagnosis, often with opposite neuroanatomical alterations relatively to controls. These subgroups were characterised by different combinations of increased or decreased patterns of morphometrics. We did not find significant clinical differences across subgroups.\nLIMITATIONS: Crucially, however, the number of subgroups and their membership differed vastly depending on chosen features and the algorithm used, highlighting the impact and importance of careful method selection.\nCONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in autism and ADHD and demonstrate that population modelling is a useful tool to study subgrouping in autism and ADHD.

Secondary objectives included assessing changes in probing depth (PD) and identifying risk factors associated with TLP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using patient records from the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. Included were 283 patients (mean age: 53.2 years) with periodontal breakdown during SPT (PiKS) who underwent single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic instrumentation. The primary outcome was TLP over a mean follow-up of 19.4 years. Secondary outcomes included changes in PD (≥ 5 mm and ≥ 6 mm) and identification of risk factors for tooth loss. Statistical analyses used multilevel binary logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and linear regression models.\nRESULTS: Among 283 patients (mean age: 53.2 years), the mean TLP was 0.9 teeth per patient over a mean follow-up of 19.4 years. Factors significantly associated with TLP included diabetes (OR = 2.41; p = 0.013), current smoking (OR = 2.13; p = 0.025), higher periodontitis Grades B and C (OR = 3.31; p = 0.001), and Stages III-IV (OR = 8.67; p = 0.001). Baseline pocket depths (PD) ≥ 5 mm (OR = 1.13; p = 0.002) and ≥ 6 mm (OR = 1.29; p = 0.001) were also associated with higher TLP. Each additional annual SPT visit reduced the TLP risk by half (OR = 0.50; p = 0.003). PD ≥ 5 mm showed minimal increase change (0.16; p = 0.02), while depths ≥ 6 mm actually decreased (-0.10; p = 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Single-visit full-mouth non-surgical therapy is effective for long-term management of PiKS, with low tooth loss rates. Diabetes, smoking, advanced periodontitis stage/grade, and deeper baseline pockets are key predictors of TLP. Frequent SPT visits significantly mitigate tooth loss risk.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: During (SPT) appointments, prevalent practice involves the full-mouth instrumentation of persistent periodontal pockets to disrupt microbial populations and consequently reduce the inflammatory response responsible for disease progression. This study investigates the efficacy of single-visit full-mouth instrumentation as a potential alternative to standard practices in controlling periodontal disease during SPT, which have potential benefits for patients, including reduced treatment time, improved adherence to maintenance therapy, and comprehensive management of periodontal disease. By minimizing the number of visits, this approach may enhance patient compliance while reducing the risk of reinfection from untreated sites between sessions, ultimately contributing to better long-term periodontal stability. Factors such as deeper baseline probing depths and crucial risk elements for TLP-including diabetes, smoking, and advanced stages (III-IV) and grades (B and C) of periodontitis, can play a role in TLP. Additionally, this study provides valuable insights into the customization of more intensive interventions for patients at higher risk. Our findings highlight the importance of frequent SPT visits, with each additional annual visit halving the risk of TLP. The observed reduction in PD of ≥ 6 mm following treatment indicates the significant potential of comprehensive debridement for enhancing long-term periodontal stability.

Despite extensive research, its pathogenesis and treatment remain only partially understood, driving continued investigation throughout 2024. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system has been linked to chronic stress responses and neuroinflammation, with neuroimaging and preclinical studies confirming altered pain and stress processing. Low-grade inflammation and metabolic disturbances, including cytokine imbalance and increased adipose tissue infiltration, further exacerbate symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota contribute to immune and emotional dysregulation. MRI studies continue to reveal brain changes that differentiate FM from other chronic pain disorders. Multi-omics approaches, including transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, show promise as diagnostic biomarkers. Mitochondrial dysfunction also emerges as a key factor, since impaired energy metabolism seems to correlate with symptom severity. From a clinical perspective, recent studies have explored under-recognised aspects of FM, such as sexual and cognitive dysfunction, the role of gender, environmental exposures, and the disease's impact on relationships and family life. The differential diagnosis of FM and long COVID has ignited discussion about potential shared mechanisms. Conversely, residual pain in inflammatory diseases remains insufficiently addressed.

Material modeling is critical for realistic biomedical simulations, and poor model selection can have life-threatening consequences for the patient. However, selecting the best model requires a profound domain knowledge and is limited to a few highly specialized experts in the field. Here we explore the feasibility of eliminating user involvement and automate the process of material modeling in finite element analyses. We leverage recent developments in constitutive neural networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to discover the best constitutive model from thousands of possible combinations of a few functional building blocks. We integrate all discoverable models into the finite element workflow by creating a universal material subroutine that contains more than 60,000 models, made up of 16 individual terms. We prototype this workflow using biaxial extension tests from healthy human arteries as input and stress and stretch profiles across the human aortic arch as output. Our results suggest that constitutive neural networks can robustly discover various flavors of arterial models from data, feed these models directly into a finite element simulation, and predict stress and strain profiles that compare favorably to the classical Holzapfel model. Replacing dozens of individual material subroutines by a single universal material subroutine-populated directly via automated model discovery-will make finite element simulations more user-friendly, more robust, and less vulnerable to human error.

A major drawback of machine harvesting is the occurrence of internal bruising, as the fruit undergoes multiple mechanical impacts during this process.

Blueberries from 61 cultivars of soft to firm types were subjected to bruise over a three-year period from 2021-2023. Dropped berries were sliced in half along the equator and digitally photographed. The captured images were first analyzed using the YOLO detection model to identify and isolate individual fruits with bounding boxes. Then YOLO segmentation models were performed on each fruit to obtain the fruit cross-section area and the bruising area, respectively. Finally, the bruising ratio was calculated by dividing the predicted bruised area by the predicted cross-sectional area. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of the bruising segmentation model was 0.94. The correlation between the bruising ratio and ground truth was 0.69 with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 15.87%.

Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) can lead to significant morbidity if not promptly identified and managed. This case report describes a patient with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who presented with HTG-AP, characterized by a lipemic blood sample, in a resource-limited setting.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled T2DM and hyperlipidemia presented with a 24-hour history of severe epigastric abdominal pain, fatigue, and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, tachypnea, tachycardia, and a habitus consistent with central obesity. His BMI was 33.2 kg/m². Initial laboratory findings included seriously elevated triglycerides (1509 mg/dL), lipase (83 U/L), and amylase (161 U/L), along with hyperglycemia (465mg/dL). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed peripancreatic fatty stranding, consistent with early acute pancreatitis, as well as a fatty liver and a focal hypodense lesion in the right lobe. Treatment included intravenous insulin, dextrose, and potassium infusions to reduce triglyceride levels, analgesics, intravenous fluids for electrolyte imbalances, and thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin.\nCONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of early recognition of HTG-AP in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

However, to our knowledge, impacts of AI-based draft radiological reporting remain unstudied in clinical settings.\nOBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the association of radiologist use of a workflow-integrated generative model capable of providing draft radiological reports for plain radiographs across a tertiary health care system with documentation efficiency, the clinical accuracy and textual quality of final radiologist reports, and the model's potential for detecting unexpected, clinically significant pneumothorax.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from November 15, 2023, to April 24, 2024, at a tertiary care academic health system. The association between use of the generative model and radiologist documentation efficiency was evaluated for radiographs documented with model assistance compared with a baseline set of radiographs without model use, matched by study type (chest or nonchest). Peer review was performed on model-assisted interpretations. Flagging of pneumothorax requiring intervention was performed on radiographs prospectively.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were association of use of the generative model with radiologist documentation efficiency, assessed by difference in documentation time with and without model use using a linear mixed-effects model; for peer review of model-assisted reports, the difference in Likert-scale ratings using a cumulative-link mixed model; and for flagging pneumothorax requiring intervention, sensitivity and specificity.\nRESULTS: A total of 23 960 radiographs (11 980 each with and without model use) were used to analyze documentation efficiency. Interpretations with model assistance (mean [SE], 159.8 [27.0] seconds) were faster than the baseline set of those without (mean [SE], 189.2 [36.2] seconds) (P = .02), representing a 15.5% documentation efficiency increase.

To circumvent the need for invasive diagnostic procedures like laparoscopy, research has increasingly focused on imaging-based methods such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The limited diagnostic accuracy achieved through manual interpretation of these imaging techniques has driven the development of automated classifiers that can effectively utilize both modalities. However, patients often undergo only one of these two examinations, resulting in unpaired data for training and testing POD obliteration classifiers, where TVUS models tend to be more accurate than MRI models, but TVUS scanning are more operator dependent. This prompts a crucial question: Can a model be trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data to enhance the performance of a model exclusively trained with MRI, while maintaining the high accuracy of the model individually trained with TVUS? In this paper we aim to answer this question by proposing a novel multi-modal POD obliteration classifier that is trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data and tested using either MRI or TVUS data. Our method is the first POD obliteration classifier that can flexibly take either the TVUS or MRI data, where the model automatically focuses on the uterus region within MRI data, eliminating the need for any manual intervention.

To maximize its advantages, future research will examine the combined effects of neophytadiene with those of other medications and naturally occurring substances. The acceptance of these phytocompounds as potential medications is clarified by elaborating on their pharmacological safety dosages and various stages of clinical testing.\nCONCLUSION: According to the reviewed studies, neophytadiene can be used as a medication candidate for treating diseases.

However, performing DSM while engaging in daily occupations can be challenging to sustain.\nOBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships among participating in daily occupations, performing DSM, maintaining target glycemic levels, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and which daily occupations (domestic, leisure, caring for others, learning, sport, self-care, quiet, spiritual, work activities) explain variations in DSM levels.\nDESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 99, M age = 65.61 yr, SD = 12.17; glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] M = 7.98, SD = 1.89; 55.6% male) who received ongoing follow-up in a public health care diabetes clinic in Israel.\nMEASURES: Participants completed the DSM, Adult Subjective Assessment of Participation, 12-item Short-Form Health Survey, and demographic questionnaires. HbA1c, fasting glucose, and body mass index information were retrieved from medical charts.\nRESULTS: Participation in recreation and leisure activities and total participation correlated with engaging in more physical activities as part of DSM and better mental and physical HRQoL. Domestic activities, caring for others, quiet activities, and work had ambivalent connections with DSM and HRQoL. Participants who engaged in more physical activities accomplished more DSM tasks; those who engaged in quiet activities (e.g., reading, watching TV) completed fewer tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Occupational therapy treatment should be personalized to identify and address specific activities within an individual's daily routine that support or hinder their DSM. Treatment should encourage clients to engage in fewer quiet activities and more physical activities to promote DSM. Plain-Language Summary: Diabetes is a common and complex health condition that requires daily management. Research shows that performing diabetes management activities, called diabetes self-management (DSM), can be challenging and difficult to sustain for many people with diabetes. Our study explored how engaging in daily activities affects DSM, including maintaining glycemic levels and health-related quality of life, for people living with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and which activities might help the most. We gathered information from medical records and questionnaires completed by 99 people with T2DM (55 men and 44 women who were, on average, 65 years old). Their average blood glucose levels were above the levels recommended by the American Diabetes Association. We found that participating in daily activities as a whole and engaging in specific activities, such as caring for others and active recreation, were associated with better health-related quality of life and increased engagement in the physical activity component of DSM. However, quieter activities, like reading or watching TV, were associated with decreased engagement in DSM activities. We recommend that occupational therapists work closely with people with T2DM to understand their daily routines and help them positively incorporate activities related to DSM.", "authors": ["Segev-Jacubovski Orit", "Mirza Mansha", "Warshawski Rozen Deena"], "published_date": "2025-07-01", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "日常職能參與、糖尿病自我管理與生活品質之間的關聯", "summary_zh": "這項研究探討了第二型糖尿病患者參與日常活動與糖尿病自我管理（DSM）及生活品質之間的關係。研究對象為99位以色列的第二型糖尿病患者，透過問卷和醫療紀錄收集數據，發現參與休閒娛樂活動與更好的身心健康生活品質，以及更多的身體活動相關。從事家務、照顧他人、安靜活動和工作與DSM和生活品質的關聯較不明顯。研究顯示，多從事身體活動的人能更好地完成DSM任務，而從事較多靜態活動（如閱讀、看電視）的人則較少完成任務。因此，職能治療應個人化，找出支持或阻礙DSM的特定活動，並鼓勵患者減少靜態活動，增加身體活動，以促進DSM。", "applications": ["想像一下，醫院的職能治療師可以根據這項研究，為糖尿病患者設計個人化的運動和活動計畫，鼓勵他們多做喜歡的運動，像是跳舞、園藝，而不是整天躺在沙發上看電視，幫助他們更好地控制血糖。", "健康管理App可以結合這項研究的結果，提醒糖尿病患者每天安排一些身體活動，例如散步、做家事，並提供相關的運動建議和追蹤功能，讓他們更容易將自我管理融入日常生活中。", "社區健康中心可以舉辦針對糖尿病患者的活動團體，鼓勵大家一起參與戶外運動、烹飪課程等，讓他們在社交互動中學習自我管理技巧，並互相支持，提升生活品質。"], "audio": "audios/40472376.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T01:19:36.520469"}

Our analysis revealed considerable accuracy for both homology models and AI-generated models. However, it also revealed the general superiority of AI methods. Particularly noteworthy is the model generated by AlphaFold2, which captured with high fidelity various structural aspects, including the challenging second extracellular loop. Our previously published homology model of the GPR101-Gs protein complex, based on the β2-adrenergic receptor, accurately predicted the binding mode of the G protein to the receptor. Moreover, this model predicted the structure of the sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) significantly more accurately than the others, including those built through AI methods, suggesting that homology modeling based on templates solved in complex with the G protein of interest might be the most reliable way of modeling this transmembrane domain.

Recently, crystallization models tailored for 2D COFs have been developed that demonstrate great potential in facilitating their rational synthesis. Nevertheless, effective strategies to leverage these models for 2D COF synthesis remain underdeveloped, and the specialized expertise required, combined with the high computational costs of exploring the vast chemical space, poses additional barriers to their practical application. In this work, we present a machine learning framework, named MlCOFSyn, that is designed to assist in the synthesis of 2D COFs. This framework explores the application of 2D COF crystallization models by implementing three pivotal functionalities: predicting crystal sizes based on the input monomer addition sequence, reverse-engineering monomer addition sequences to achieve desired crystal sizes, and optimizing monomer addition sequences to produce larger crystals. These functionalities are critical for the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs but have been largely underexplored due to the lack of accessible theoretical tools.

A modified microwave-based synthesis approach was used in this study to synthesize spherical core-shell hybrid cobalt oxide carbon nanodot (Co3O4@CND) NPs of a smaller size of around 20 nm. Four different targeting ligands─folic acid, heparin, PEGylated silica (SiO2), and transferrin─and the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) were conjugated to the hybrid NPs, and their physicochemical characterizations were evaluated for their applications. The bioimaging, antioxidant, biocompatibility, cancer-targeting ability, and anticancerous specificity effect of the hybrid NPs were examined using A549 (lung cancer) cells and compared with CNDs, Co3O4 NPs, and the ligand-conjugated NPs. The Co3O4@CND NPs demonstrated high fluorescence from their synergistic properties, leading to a better bioimaging ability in human cells. The Co3O4@CND hybrid NP-transferrin-DOX composite targeted 50% of A549 cells with a much less adverse effect on EAhy926 (endothelial) cells at the same concentrations.

The information extraction was guided by the framework for outcome evaluation in implementation science, the RE-AIM framework. We performed meta-analyses for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a random-effects model and presented Forrest plots and test statistics (Cochran's Q and I2) for heterogeneity analysis. Other results that did not lend themselves to quantitative analysis were summarized qualitatively.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included in the review. The studies were evaluated according to the RE-AIM framework, and most studies reported effectiveness well, while all other dimensions were poorly reported. Most studies demonstrated that SMA effectively improved patients' Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) levels and reduced healthcare costs. However, the SMA was a highly resource-demanded and complex intervention package.\nDISCUSSION: The available evidence suggests that the SMA was beneficial in improving PLWD management and health outcomes among PLWD.

Data on participant characteristics, measurement systems, outcome measures, results, and risk of bias were systematically extracted.\nRESULTS: In total, 38 studies published between 2004 and 2024, including 29 observational studies and 9 interventional studies, met the inclusion criteria. Various gait parameters were used, including spatio-temporal, kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography (EMG) parameters. Walking speed and range-of-motion (ROM) knee were identified as important parameters for differentiating HSP patients from healthy controls, but these parameters are more general rather than disease-specific. Foot lift, ROM foot, and gait variability are promising, more disease-specific parameters, as they reflect disease severity and increased balance deficits. However, a deeper understanding of all gait parameter categories is necessary, particularly for the upper body. Few studies explored sub-cohorts that exhibit different HSP gait characteristics.\nCONCLUSION: While MOCAP provides valuable data in controlled hospital environments, there is a need for validated mobile sensor systems capturing the gait patterns of HSP patients in real-life without supervision.

Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying CRC liver metastasis and resistance to immune therapy remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CRC metastasis using a novel approach, which includes the establishment of highly metastatic CRC cell lines.\nMETHODS: To explore the role of specific genes in CRC liver metastasis, we developed two highly metastatic CRC cell lines (LoVo-Hm and HCT116-Hm) by applying sustained selective pressure to primary CRC cells. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in these metastatic cells. Additionally, we conducted assays for cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and ELISA to evaluate VEGFA production, all to confirm the functional role of SLC9A2. Our findings were further validated in human CRC tissue samples and publicly available datasets to assess the clinical relevance of the identified targets.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant downregulation of SLC9A2 in the highly metastatic CRC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found that SLC9A2 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, SLC9A2 reduces VEGFA secretion, normalizing tumor vasculature and reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME), which ultimately enhances anti-tumor immunity. Comparative analysis of CRC tissue samples showed reduced SLC9A2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, with a negative correlation to TNM staging. Importantly, higher SLC9A2 expression was associated with better treatment responses in immunotherapy cohorts.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of SLC9A2 in regulating metastasis, angiogenesis, and TME remodeling in CRC.

However, the standard non-iterative g-formula implementation requires specifying both the conditional distribution of the outcomes and the joint distribution of all time-varying covariates. This process can be cumbersome to implement and is prone to model misspecification bias. As an alternative, the iterative conditional expectation (ICE) g-formula estimator solely depends on a series of nested outcome regressions and avoids the need for specifying the full distribution of all time-varying covariates. This simplicity lends itself to the natural integration of flexible machine learning techniques to develop more robust average causal effect estimators with time-varying treatments. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian approach that includes parametric regressions and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees to flexibly model a series of outcome surfaces.

ChatGPT, an AI chatbot trained through deep learning, can analyze basic problems and produce human-like language in various subjects. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are given to students by many medical schools before exams, but due to time constraints, instructors frequently lack the resources necessary to adequately explain the practice questions.

MALDI-MSI was used to locate several lipids identified using LC-MS/MS to determine changes in their distribution in the epidermis.\nRESULTS: There were 252 lipids in RHE models deregulated by irradiation, including multiple phospholipid classes, triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, sphingolipids, and ceramides. Of these, only four were still modulated when the sunscreen was applied prior to irradiation. MALDI-MSI imaging of control RHE sections alongside optical images detected 4115 lipids which were tentatively identified using the LipidMaps database associated with distinct areas in the tissue. One key lipid linked to keratinocyte differentiation during photoaging, 25-hydroxycholesterol, was present in low levels in control RHE models but increased significantly after irradiation.

Across 19 cohorts, 11,175 parent-newborn pairs contributed information on at least one prenatal smoking exposure, mostly from questionnaires. Maternal blood or urine cotinine measurements, available in a few studies, provided objective data on maternal SHS and smoking during pregnancy. Primary analyses used Illumina450K methylation data; secondary analyses in 5 cohorts examined CpGs unique to the EPIC array.\nRESULTS: Maternal sustained smoking associated with differential DNA methylation (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) at 8,862 CpGs on the 450K (n=8,148) and did not differ by infant sex. We identified over 300 novel genes not previously identified in EWAS of smoking. No differential methylation was associated with maternal SHS, maternal former smoking, or paternal smoking around conception. However, cg24805739 (MED13L) was associated with paternal former smoking. Forty-one novel genes were identified using maternal cotinine measurements compared to questionnaire.

Robust and accurate glioblastoma segmentation methods are essential to maximize the benefits of this imaging modality. Given the importance of setting the foreground threshold during manual tumor delineation, this study investigates the added value of incorporating such prior knowledge to guide the automated segmentation and improve performance. Two segmentation networks were trained based on the nnU-Net guidelines: one with the [18F]FET PET image as sole input, and one with an additional input channel for the threshold map. For the latter, we investigate the benefit of manually obtained thresholds and explore automated prediction and generation of such maps. A fully automated pipeline was constructed by selecting the best performing threshold prediction approach and cascading this with the tumor segmentation model.\nRESULTS: The proposed two-channel network shows increased performance with guidance of threshold maps originating from the same reader whose ground-truth tumor label the prediction is compared to (DSC = 0.901). When threshold maps were generated by a different reader, performance reverted to levels comparable to the one-channel network and inter-reader variability. The proposed full pipeline achieves results on par with current state of the art (DSC = 0.807).\nCONCLUSIONS: Incorporating a threshold map can significantly improve tumor segmentation performance when it aligns well with the ground-truth label.

When stratifying patients by indication for transplantation (moderate vs. severe cytopenia vs. persistent poor prognosis cytogenetic alterations/acute myeloid leukemia), we found a 5-year cumulative mortality higher, though not significantly (p = 0.281) in the last group. Cancers were the second most common cause of death in the whole cohort after infections. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent cancer, followed by hematologic neoplasms. The cumulative incidence of solid/hematological malignancy remarkably increased after 20 years of age and was 51.7% at age 40 years. The risk of malignancies was greater in subjects who received HSCT (sub-distribution azard ratio 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1-7.5, p = 0.024). We also identified a small group of patients with stable or even improved cytopenia over time without transplant, thus confirming that bone marrow failure is not automatic in all patients and heightening the importance of tight monitoring to surveil on the worsening of hematopoietic function and cancer occurrence.

Digital interventions can affect people's experiences of self-managing a chronic condition, and SMS text messages may provide an effective delivery method for an intervention. The Support Through Mobile Messaging and Digital Health Technology for Diabetes (SuMMiT-D) intervention uses evidence-based SMS text messages to support people with type 2 diabetes with regular and consistent use of diabetes medication.\nOBJECTIVE: This process analysis, conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial of SuMMiT-D, aimed to explore (1) the contextual factors that may interact with the SuMMiT-D intervention and (2) the self-reported mechanisms through which change in behavior or attitude might occur.\nMETHODS: A nested qualitative process study was conducted within primary care in England. A total of 43 trial participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were assigned to receive the SuMMiT-D intervention, were undergoing oral glucose-lowering treatment, blood pressure-lowering treatment or lipid-lowering treatment, either alone or in combination, and had access to a mobile phone, took part in semistructured telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: In total, 2 overarching themes were developed exploring relevant contextual factors and potential mechanisms of change. The system exerted a range of holistic benefits and supported the cognitions, beliefs, and behaviors necessary for longitudinal self-management. The perceived value of the messages was fluid and linked to contextual need. Appraisal of the system was influenced by existing routines, lifestyle disruption, people's understanding of type 2 diabetes, relationships with other people, and subjective attitudes toward living with type 2 diabetes in contemporary society.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the value of engaging people longitudinally in thinking about their general health, the importance of interrogating context, and the holistic benefit of health messaging.

Artificial intelligence's (AI) potential contributions, although significant in the field of medicine, have not been adequately studied in the context of adolescents' mental health.\nOBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify AI interventions that have been tested, implemented, or both, for use in adolescents' mental health care.\nMETHODS: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework, further refined by Levac et al, along with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, to guide this scoping review. We searched 5 electronic databases from the inception date through July 2024 (inclusive). Four independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, read the full texts, and extracted data using a validated data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a fifth reviewer was sought. We evaluated the risk of bias (ROB) for prognosis and diagnosis-related studies using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for reporting.\nRESULTS: Of the papers screened, 88 papers relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the included papers, AI was most commonly used for diagnosis (n=78), followed by monitoring and evaluation (n=19), treatment (n=10), and prognosis (n=6). As some studies addressed multiple applications, categories are not mutually exclusive. For diagnosis, studies primarily addressed suicidal behaviors (n=11) and autism spectrum disorder (n=7). Machine learning was the most frequently reported AI method across all application areas. The overall ROB for diagnostic and prognostic models was predominantly unclear (58%), while 20% of studies had a high ROB and 22% were assessed as low risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our review, we found that AI is being applied across various areas of adolescent mental health care, spanning diagnosis, treatment planning, symptom monitoring, and prognosis. Interestingly, most studies to date have concentrated heavily on diagnostic tools, leaving other important aspects of care relatively underexplored. This presents a key opportunity for future research to broaden the scope of AI applications beyond diagnosis.

Certifying quantum networks becomes even more crucial when the privacy of their users is exposed to malicious quantum nodes or servers as in the case of multiclient distributed blind quantum computing, where several clients delegate a joint private computation to remote quantum servers, such as federated quantum machine learning. In such protocols, security must be provided not only by keeping data hidden but also by verifying that the server is correctly performing the requested computation while minimizing the hardware assumptions on the employed devices. Notably, standard verification techniques fail in scenarios where the clients receive quantum states from untrusted sources such as in a recently demonstrated linear quantum network performing multiclient blind quantum computation.

There are potential opportunities to provide quality care through population health management (PHM) interventions in the hopes of improving downstream outcomes and costs. In Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (CHAMP), a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial, patients received a PHM, multidisciplinary team approach to improve CKD care or usual care. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a post-hoc comparative analysis of the one-year healthcare utilization between patients who received the PHM intervention compared to usual care with a secondary objective of comparing standardized costs.\nMETHODS: A subset of Kidney CHAMP patients who had available health insurance claims with enrollment for the full 12 months in the year following trial enrollment were included. Inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy standardized costs were estimated using diagnosis-related groups, current procedural terminology, and National Drug Codes, respectively. Resource utilization was analyzed using negative binomial models and costs were analyzed using two-part models. All analyses were adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. Subgroups were analyzed by age, sex, CKD stage, and diabetes status.\nRESULTS: Of the 1,596 trial participants, 614 patients met inclusion criteria (PHM: 300; usual care: 314). Patients in the PHM arm had 27% fewer inpatient hospitalizations than usual care (incident rate ratio=0.73; 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), but outpatient visits did not differ significantly. Total standardized costs were similar between the PHM and usual care treatment arms across inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy categories.\nCONCLUSION: The PHM intervention reduced inpatient hospitalizations but did not significantly impact healthcare costs over one year.

To achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice, risk factors identified by these models must be validated in diverse populations.\nMETHODS: In this cohort study, 86 870 community-dwelling older adults ≥65 years from the UK Biobank database were used to train and test three ML models to predict 30-day emergency hospitalisation. The three ML models, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Logistic Regression (LR), utilised all extracted variables, consisting of demographic and geriatric syndromes, comorbidities, and the Drug Burden Index (DBI), a measure of potentially inappropriate polypharmacy, which quantifies exposure to medications with anticholinergic and sedative properties. 30-day emergency hospitalisation was defined as any hospitalisation related to any clinical event within 30 days of the index date. The model performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) and the F1 score.\nRESULTS: The AUC-ROC for the RF, XGB and LR models was 0.78, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively, signifying good discriminatory power.

Symptom network analyses offer a powerful tool to examine these interactions, but few studies have directly compared symptom networks in younger and older adults.\nMETHODS: We analysed data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) study, including 786 participants aged 18 to 88, who reported at least subclinical levels of symptoms on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Network analysis was employed to examine symptom communities (clusters of related symptoms), within- and between-community connectivity (association strength), and centrality (symptom importance) across age groups.\nRESULTS: The overall network structure, separating anxiety and depressive symptoms into two communities, remained stable. However, older adults showed reduced connectivity within depression and between depression and anxiety. While 'panic' was a consistently central symptom, 'rumination' and 'restlessness' were the key bridge symptoms (i.e. linking anxiety and depression) in young and older adults, respectively.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings reveal both stable and dynamic aspects of depression and anxiety symptoms across the lifespan.

The prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes has been increasing among active duty service members. The Department of Defense spends over 3 billion dollars annually managing these conditions. Despite known links between lifestyle factors and disease, lifestyle and performance medicine (LPM) is not commonly integrated into medical education. This research aims to assess military medical students' knowledge, perceptions, and preparedness regarding LPM.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved survey among a select group of medical students participating in the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) or attending the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) was performed. The survey was distributed via the Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons email list and military social media pages. The survey intended to gather student perspectives and preparedness to incorporate LPM into future practice. Demographics data were also collected and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and R-studio.\nRESULTS: Of 107 students across 24 medical institutions, 95% felt LPM was relevant to their careers as military physicians. However, only 45% felt adequately prepared by their institutions, and only 30% felt they gained in-depth experience regarding LPM skills like nutrition and exercise prescriptions in medical school. Notably, 78% thought their medical institutions should dedicate more time to LPM in the medical school curriculum.\nDISCUSSION: Most students in this study do not feel adequately prepared to incorporate LPM interventions and think they would benefit from more LPM training in their medical school curriculum. These results are consistent with previous studies performed among civilian medical students. This study was conducted exclusively among military medical students, many indicated that they feel the principles of LPM are important to force readiness and missions preparedness. However, they also feel that they lack the skills necessary to adequately integrate LPM into their future practice. This study has several limitations. Responses were collected voluntarily in a non-randomized fashion leaving the possibility for selection bias. Additionally, the survey was available for 4 weeks in the summer of 2024. The methods in which the survey was collected makes so an exact response rate cannot be calculated. However, this study offers valuable insight into the demand for LPM education among current military medical students and the implications LPM can have on future force health and deployment readiness.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore an expectation among military medical students to integrate more comprehensive LPM education within military medical training programs. By enhancing LPM education, military medical students may be better prepared to address noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity.

Quality was evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale, which assessed various dimensions of app quality, including subjective quality, engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information. An automatic readability index calculator was implemented to assess readability by using the count of words, syllables, and sentences to generate a score indicative of the reading difficulty level. Content analysis was conducted to examine the apps' availability, characteristics, and functionality.\nRESULTS: Out of 369 apps initially identified, 27 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. The quality of the apps was assessed using Mobile Application Rating Scale, with an average score of 3.45 out of 5 (SD 0.5), indicating a need for quality improvement. The readability analysis revealed suboptimal scores, with an average grade level of 6.62 (SD 2.2) for in-app content and 9.93 (SD 2.6) for app store descriptions. These results, combined with a monotonous user interface, suggest that many apps lack a child-friendly design, potentially hindering their usability and engagement for young users. Content analysis categorized the apps into 3 functional groups-chatbot-based apps (15 apps), journal logging apps (9 apps), and psychotherapeutic treatment apps (3 apps). While 20 out of 27 apps (74%) used clinically validated technologies, rigorous clinical tests of the apps were often missing, with only 2 apps undergoing clinical trials. Of the 27 apps analyzed, only 7 (26%) were free to use, while the majority, 20 apps, required a subscription or one-time payment. Among the paid apps, the average cost was US $20.16 per month, which may pose a financial barrier and limit accessibility for some users, particularly those from lower-income households.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-based mental health apps hold significant potential to address the unique challenges of child mental health but face critical limitations in design, accessibility, and validation.

Hence, accurate identification and prediction of OLNM are of great significance.\nAIM: This study aimed to develop and validate an explainable machine learning (ML) model to predict OLNM in OTSCC.\nMETHODS: A total of 678 Early-stage OTSCC patients from multiple centers were enrolled and randomly classified into the derivation and external validation cohorts. The variables considered in this study primarily included clinicopathological characteristics associated with the occurrence of OLNM in OTSCC. Feature selection utilized multivariate logistic regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Meanwhile, 6 ML algorithms were employed to develop an OLNM diagnostic model, assessed with area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), sensitivity, specificity, and validation cohorts. Moreover, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to rank the feature importance and interpret the final model.\nRESULTS: In this study, 192 patients (34.7%) developed OLNM in the derivation cohort, while 38 patients (30.6%) developed OLNM in the external validation cohort. Through feature selection, 9 clinicopathological variables were identified as independent predictive factors for OLNM, and six ML models were developed based on these factors. Among the six evaluated ML models, the Random Forest (RF) model achieved the highest AUC (0.941, 95% CI: 0.907-0.975) for internal validation. External validation further confirmed the RF model's effectiveness, yielding an AUC of 0.917 (95% CI: 0.868-0.967). The calibration curves also demonstrated a high level of concordance between the anticipated risk and the observed risk of the RF model. Additionally, this study also compared the RF model with the currently accepted traditional statistical methods, including depth of invasion (DOI) and tumor budding (TB), demonstrating superior prediction performance and greater clinical application value. Ultimately, an online computing platform (https://prediction-model-for-olnm.streamlit.app/) for this RF model is freely available to both clinicians and patients.\nCONCLUSION: This study innovatively utilized 9 easily obtained clinicopathological features to construct an explainable RF model, providing a practical and reliable tool for predicting OLNM in Early-stage OTSCC.

Survival analysis and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to assess the data.\nRESULTS: Higher NPAR levels were significantly associated with increased BC risk in the unadjusted model, with quartile comparisons revealing an odds ratio (OR) of 1.51 (95% CI: 0.99-2.29, p = 0.057). After adjustment, the OR increased to 1.70 (95% CI: 1.12-2.57, p < 0.05), indicating the robustness of this association. Elevated NPAR levels were also linked to higher all-cause mortality (ACM). Multivariate Cox regression models showed that a one-unit increase in NPAR was associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07-1.12) for overall mortality and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.13-1.22) for cardiovascular disease mortality, both with p-values < 0.001.

The first dataset comprises 30,000 SNPs from 865 European beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees, the second dataset consists of 381 SNPs from 1,883 pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) trees. The accuracy, as measured by the geographic distance between true and predicted locations, was highest for the GPR-G and DL methods with the beech dataset with a median distance of only 55 km and 76 km, respectively. For the oak data GPR-G and DL also performed best with median distances of 263 km and 278 km, respectively. The relative error (distance/max distance among tree pairs) was below 8% for 90% of all samples for the best method for both datasets. We detected 35 individuals and 10 groups as outliers in the beech data and 27 individuals and 18 groups in the oak data. These outliers may be caused by mislabelling or historical human-caused long distance seed transfer.

Only patients with a minimum follow-up duration of six months were included. IOP measurements were recorded at baseline and at week 1, and months 1, 2, 3, and 6 post-injection. These values were compared using either the paired Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, depending on data distribution. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for steroid-induced ocular hypertension (SIOHT).\nRESULTS: The incidence of SIOHT was 38% (n = 412 eyes). The mean baseline IOP was 15.73 ± 3.4 mmHg, which peaked at month 1 (17.81 ± 4.0 mmHg, p < 0.001) and month 2 (17.30 ± 4.4 mmHg, p < 0.001), then declined and returned close to baseline by month 6 (15.38 ± 4.1 mmHg, p = 0.258). Multivariate analysis revealed that age (40-50 years, OR 2.95, p = 0.001), male gender (OR 1.82, p = 0.001), and higher baseline IOP (OR 1.09, p = 0.003) were significant independent risk factors.

Thus, this review innovatively takes antioxidant proteins as the entry point, and for the first time systematically summarizes the molecular mechanism of antioxidant proteins to improve DCM by regulating the ferroptosis pathway, and summarizes the therapeutic strategy of medications to enhance ferroptosis in DCM by targeting the expression of antioxidant proteins, to explore the potential targets to improve ferroptosis in DCM, to provide a new perspective for the study of delaying the progression of DCM.", "authors": ["Lin Yuting", "Yang Shu", "Guo Jinjian"], "published_date": "2025-06-07", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "抗氧化蛋白可能是改善糖尿病心肌病中鐵死亡的潛在標靶：文獻回顧", "summary_zh": "糖尿病心肌病(DCM)是糖尿病常見的心血管併發症，與冠心病等引起的心肌損傷不同。早期DCM症狀不明顯，現有治療主要為症狀控制。研究顯示，即使血糖控制良好，DCM的病理進程仍未減緩。鐵死亡是一種鐵依賴性的細胞死亡，在DCM心肌損傷中扮演重要角色。抗氧化防禦系統失調、氧化壓力增加和活性氧升高是DCM中鐵死亡的關鍵機制。本篇回顧創新性地以抗氧化蛋白為切入點，系統性地總結抗氧化蛋白通過調節鐵死亡途徑改善DCM的分子機制，並總結了通過靶向抗氧化蛋白的表達來增強DCM中鐵死亡的藥物治療策略，旨在探索改善DCM中鐵死亡的潛在標靶，為延緩DCM進展的研究提供新的視角。", "applications": ["開發新藥：針對抗氧化蛋白，設計能有效抑制鐵死亡的新藥，有望減緩甚至阻止糖尿病患者心肌病變的惡化。", "早期篩檢：透過檢測特定抗氧化蛋白的含量，可以更早發現有心肌病變風險的糖尿病患者，及早介入治療。", "個人化治療：根據患者抗氧化蛋白的表現，制定更精準的治療方案，提升治療效果，延緩疾病進程。"], "audio": "audios/40481517.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-08T03:51:46.819296"}

User behaviour and readiness for AI can be predicted by various factors, such as perceived usefulness (PU) of AI, personality traits and mental health-related variables. Investigating these factors is essential for understanding user acceptance and the future use of AI tools in mental health. This study examines the individual factors that influence the PU of AI in mental health care. In addition, it examines how PU of AI affects the use of mental health apps. For ethical and practical reasons, these apps were considered independently of their AI integration, aiming to support the development of AI-driven mental health applications.\nMETHOD: In a German-speaking convenience sample N = 302 participants socio-demographic information, personality factors, mental health status, mental health literacy, and various aspects concerning the integration of AI into psychosocial care (PU, AI awareness, digital skills, app use in general) were assessed. Two linear, stepwise regression analyses were conducted, with PU of AI and the participants' use of mental health apps in general as dependent variables, respectively, and the above-mentioned variables as predictors. Profession, gender, own experience with mental impairments, AI awareness and digital skills were included as covariates. Finally, we performed two moderation analyses to investigate mental health problems and psychological distress as moderators for the relationship between PU and frequency of mental health-related app use-irrespective of AI integration-with working field and digital capabilities as covariates.\nRESULTS: Higher openness, pessimism and conscientiousness predicted lower PU, whereas higher agreeableness, lower levels of stigma and social distance predicted higher PU. The covariates psychological/ pedagogical training, digital capabilities and experience had a significant influence on PU. Higher frequency of app use in general was predicted by better digital capabilities, higher psychological distress, and more help seeking behaviour. The relationship between PU and the overall use of mental health apps was moderated by psychological distress but not by mental health problems.\nDISCUSSION: Our study identified individual factors influencing PU for integrating AI into psychosocial care and the frequency of using mental health apps-irrespective of AI integration-and thereby underlines the necessity to tailor AI interventions in psychosocial care to individual needs, personality, and abilities of users to enhance their acceptance and effectiveness.", "authors": ["Fritz Birthe", "Eppelmann Lena", "Edelmann Annika", "Rohrmann Sonja", "Wessa Michèle"], "published_date": "2025-06-06", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "心理健康狀態與態度如何影響人工智慧在心理社會照護中的接受度：一項橫斷面分析", "summary_zh": "本研究探討影響人們對心理健康照護中使用人工智慧（AI）接受度的因素。研究發現，人格特質、心理健康狀況和對心理健康的態度都會影響人們對AI的接受度。例如，較高的開放性、悲觀主義和盡責性與較低的AI接受度有關，而較高的隨和性、較低的病恥感和社會距離則與較高的AI接受度有關。此外，心理困擾程度會影響人們使用心理健康App的頻率。研究強調，為了提高AI在心理社會照護中的接受度和有效性，需要根據使用者的個人需求、人格和能力來客製化AI介入方案。", "applications": ["想像一下，未來AI可以根據你的個性，推薦最適合你的心理健康App或線上諮詢服務，就像專屬的心理健康管家。", "如果你的朋友或家人因為對心理疾病有偏見，不願意尋求協助，AI可以透過匿名的方式，提供他們相關資訊和支持，降低他們的疑慮。", "對於住在偏鄉地區，難以獲得心理健康資源的人們，AI可以提供24小時的線上支持，打破時間和空間的限制。"], "audio": "audios/40481588.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-08T06:23:03.663543"}

This study evaluates the efficacy of deep learning algorithms for detecting and diagnosing dental caries using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with the Mask R-CNN architecture while comparing various hyperparameters to enhance detection.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,128 CBCT images were divided into training and validation and test datasets in a 7:1:1 ratio. For the verification of tooth recognition, the data from the validation set were randomly selected for analysis. Three groups of Mask R-CNN networks were compared: A scratch-trained baseline using randomly initialized weights (R group); A transfer learning approach with models pre-trained on COCO for object detection (C group); A variant pre-trained on ImageNetfor for object detection (I group). All configurations maintained identical hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. The deep learning model used ResNet-50 as the backbone network and was trained to 300epoch respectively. We assessed training loss, detection and training times, diagnostic accuracy, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and coverage precision to compare performance across the groups.\nRESULTS: Transfer learning significantly reduced training times compared to non-transfer learning approach (p < 0.05). The average detection time for group R was 0.269 ± 0.176 s, whereas groups I (0.323 ± 0.196 s) and C (0.346 ± 0.195 s) exhibited significantly longer detection times (p < 0.05). C-group, trained for 200 epochs, achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 81.095, outperforming all other groups. The mAP for caries recognition in group R, trained for 300 epochs, was 53.328, with detection times under 0.5 s. Overall, C-group demonstrated significantly higher average precision across all epochs (100, 200, and 300) (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Neural networks pre-trained with COCO transfer learning exhibit superior annotation accuracy compared to those pre-trained with ImageNet. This suggests that COCO's diverse and richly annotated images offer more relevant features for detecting dental structures and carious lesions.

Pregnant women, as a highly vulnerable population, are frequently exposed to pervasive chiral chemicals that can cross the placenta, with the placenta serving as an enantioselective barrier. Despite significant research on enantioselective transfer of xenobiotics using various models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro), a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of xenobiotics-plasma protein binding remains lacking. This review provides a state-of-the-art synthesis of the characteristics and mechanisms governing the enantioselective transplacental transfer of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial additives-representative chiral xenobiotics of significant public health concern. We highlight how xenobiotics, acting as ligands, interact with proteins, influencing enantioselective transfer through key processes such as plasma protein binding, transporter-mediated biotransport, and enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation. Notably, the binding of xenobiotics to human serum albumin (HSA) rather than α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is shown to primarily inhibit the transmembrane transport of small molecules. Whereas limited docking studies suggest Sudlow site II as a pivotal site for enantioselective binding. Additionally, P-glycoprotein (permeability glycoprotein, P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) are important in determining the enantiomeric distribution between maternal and fetus.

Diabetic women with HFpEF represent a high-risk subgroup, particularly after experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), exhibiting increased mortality compared to men. While prolonged door-to-balloon (DTB) times, reflecting delayed reperfusion, are a critical factor in STEMI outcomes, they alone do not fully capture the observed outcome variability in diabetic women. Using an integrated clinical and pre-clinical approach this study aimed to investigate the relative contributions of metabolic dysfunction and coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) to STEMI outcomes in women, beyond the impact of DTB time.\nMETHODS: A retrospective case-control study analysed female STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI, n = 40 T2D, n = 40 non-diabetic controls), comparing clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and early outcomes. A preclinical model (female db/db mice) assessed cardiac function via echocardiography, Langendorff perfusions, and ischemia-reperfusion protocols. Metabolome of heart, liver, and skeletal muscle was assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: Our study reveals significantly higher mortality, impaired left ventricular function post-pPCI, and increased implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates in diabetic STEMI patients, irrespective of DTB time, when compared to non-diabetic controls. Elevated inflammatory markers, acute hyperglycaemia and evidence of cardio-hepatic damage were identified in T2D patients. db/db mice exhibited analogous T2D-associated pathophysiology, including increased ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by metabolic disturbances in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle versus non-diabetic controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays exacerbate acute myocardial injury.

These components are closely linked to the onset and progression of malignancies, as well as their treatment. The TME is characterized by aberrant vasculature, altered extracellular matrix, immune cells, secreted factors, and cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophages. The importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in understanding the course of cancer and resistance to treatment has been highlighted. The TME can suppress immune responses and promote tumor survival by inducing immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and checkpoint molecule expression (e.g., PD-L1). Recent research has focused on understanding the interactions between immune cells within the TME to develop strategies that can remodel this environment and increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies is frequently hindered by the immunosuppressive nature of the TME. This abstract explores how these dynamics have led to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming the TME to enhance antitumor immune responses.

Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death.\nRESULTS: (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function across groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed that the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, while the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) decreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation with the GFR (P < 0.01).

These impairments are not typically addressed during assessment or rehabilitation. Currently, most robotic paradigms for training of the upper limb have focused solely on improving motor function or have targeted proprioception in individuals with combined use of visual feedback. Our goal was to design a training paradigm that directly targets proprioception of the upper limb, while minimizing reliance on other sensory information to improve sensorimotor function after stroke.\nMETHODS: In this pilot study, 5 individuals with stroke and 5 age-matched controls were tested on a single-day proprioceptive training paradigm. Here, participants used a joystick with their less-affected arm to send commands to a KINARM exoskeleton that would passively move their more-affected arm. To complete the passive reaching task, participants relied only on proprioceptive feedback from the more-affected arm and were only given knowledge of results information after each trial. Sensorimotor function of the upper limb was measured pre- and post-training via robotic measures of motor function [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR)] and position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)]. Sensorimotor function was quantified as a Task Score, which incorporated multiple task-relevant parameters for both VGR and APM. Changes in sensorimotor performance due to training were calculated as the pre- to post-training difference for VGR and APM within the control and stroke groups.\nRESULTS: We found significant improvements from pre-training to post-training for VGR in individuals with stroke (p < 0.001, CLES = 100) that were not observed in control participants (p = 0.87, CLES = 80). We observed significant changes from pre- to post-training in both VGR (Posture Speed, Reaction Time, Initial Direction Angle, Min-Max Speed Difference, and Movement Time) and APM (Contraction/Expansion Ratiox and Shifty) parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel proprioceptive training paradigm is one of the first to implement a self-guided sensory training protocol. We observed improvements in motor function and proprioception for individuals with stroke. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of self-guided proprioceptive training to improve motor and sensory function in individuals with stroke.

Using crash data from the Department for Transport covering crashes in Great Britain from 2016 to 2019, the research evaluates the methodology's effectiveness.

A question arises on the impact of the interplay between blood circulation and dynamic delivery on blood dose.\nPURPOSE: This study answers the question by introducing a new whole-body blood circulation modeling technique.\nMETHODS: A whole-body CT with intravenous contrast was used to develop the blood circulation model. Fifteen organs and tissues, heart chambers, and great vessels were segmented using a deep-learning-based auto-contouring software. The main blood vessels were segmented using an in-house algorithm. Blood density, velocity, time-to-heart, and perfusion distributions were derived for systole, diastole, and portal circulations and used to simulate trajectories of blood particles during delivery. With the same prescription of 12 Gy in 8 fractions, doses to circulating blood were calculated for three plans: (1) an IM-TBI plan prescribing uniform dose to the whole body while reducing lung and kidney doses; (2) a TMI plan treating all bones; and (3) a TMLI plan treating all bones, major lymph nodes, and spleen; TMI and TMLI plans were optimized to reduce doses to non-target tissue.\nRESULTS: Circulating blood received 1.57 ± 0.43 Gy, 1.04 ± 0.32 Gy, and 1.09 ± 0.32 Gy in one fraction and 12.60 ± 1.21 Gy, 8.34 ± 0.88 Gy, and 8.71 ± 0.92 Gy in 8 fractions in IM-TBI, TMI, and TMLI, respectively. The interplay effect of blood motion with IM delivery did not change the mean dose, but changed the dose heterogeneity of the circulating blood. Fractionation reduced the blood dose heterogeneity.\nCONCLUSIONS: A novel whole-body blood circulating model was developed based on patient-specific anatomy and realistic blood dynamics, concentration, and perfusion.

CRISPR-Cas9 is the most common genome editing tool, but it often induces byproduct insertions and deletions in addition to the desired edits. Therefore, genome editing of iPS cells produces diverse genotypes. Existing assays mostly analyze genome editing results in cell populations, but not in single cells. However, systematic profiling of genome editing outcomes in single iPS cells was lacking. Due to the high mortality of human iPS cells as isolated single cells, it has been difficult to analyze genome-edited iPS cell clones in a high-throughput manner.\nMETHODS: In this study, we developed a method for high-throughput iPS cell clone isolation based on the precise robotic picking of cell clumps derived from single cells grown in extracellular matrices. We first introduced point mutations into human iPS cell pools by CRISPR-Cas9. These genome-edited human iPS cells were dissociated and cultured as single cells in extracellular matrices to form cell clumps, which were then isolated using a cell-handling robot to establish genome-edited human iPS cell clones. Genome editing outcomes in these clones were analyzed by amplicon sequencing to determine the genotypes of individual iPS cell clones. We identified and distinguished the sequences of different insertions and deletions induced by CRISPR-Cas9 while determining their genotypes. We also cryopreserved the established iPS cell clones and recovered them after determining their genotypes.\nRESULTS: We analyzed over 1,000 genome-edited iPS cell clones and found that homozygous editing was much more frequent than heterozygous editing. We also observed frequent homozygous induction of identical genetic manipulations, including insertions and deletions, such as 1-bp insertions and 8-bp deletions. Moreover, we successfully cryopreserved and then recovered genome-edited iPS cell clones, demonstrating that our cell-handling robot-based method is valuable in establishing genome-edited iPS cell clones.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a previously unknown property of genome editing in human iPS cells that identical sequence manipulations tend to be induced in both copies of the target sequence in individual cells.

The National Fire Incident Reporting System serves as a repository for these data, but inconsistency and variability in reporting practices across departments often lead to challenges in data quality and utility. This study aims to enhance emergency incident categorization and explore the feasibility of an automated system using free-text incident data from the National Fire Operations Reporting System (NFORS).\nMETHOD: Researchers extracted and standardized 3,564 unique 9-1-1 incident descriptions from six fire departments using NFORS data, including narrative fields from emergency reports. The data were preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF and n-grams). These features were used to train and evaluate Machine Learning (ML) models, including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, to classify incidents into nine categories. The NLP techniques prepared the text data for the ML models, which performed the classification and assessed the automated system's performance.\nRESULTS: The study demonstrated significant improvements in incident categorization accuracy using the NLP and ML approach. Unigram models achieved 93% accuracy when applied to 3,564 unique incident descriptions. This performance was evaluated by comparing the automated classifications to manually assigned categories, which served as the reference.

However, squamous cell carcinomas from different sites lack representative histological and immunohistochemical features. This study aimed to identify mutational profiles and further establish a DNA methylation-based classification for squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. Samples of unambiguous squamous cell carcinomas and urothelial carcinomas were collected for targeted next-generation sequencing and mutational landscape analysis. Moreover, using Illumina methylation BeadChip data from public datasets and a local cohort, we developed a DNA methylation-based classifier utilizing the CatBoost algorithm to identify four common types of squamous cell carcinoma (lung, head and neck, esophagus, and cervix) as well as urothelial carcinoma.\nRESULTS: The DNA mutational profiles of squamous cell carcinomas from different sites overlapped greatly, and there was no significant difference in tumor mutation burden or microsatellite status. On the basis of public datasets and analyses via various machine learning algorithms, a DNA methylation-based classification containing 106 features by the CatBoost algorithm was constructed and reached an accuracy of 98.79% (490/496) in the training set from PanCanAtlas datasets. The predictive accuracies of the methylation classification in the public validation set and local FUSCC validation set 1 with known primary were 86.96% (340/391) and 84.87% (101/119), respectively. The predictive accuracy for the primary samples (89.66%, 78/87) was obviously greater than that for the metastatic samples (71.88%, 23/32). FUSCC validation set 2 included ten complicated cancer of unknown primary (CUP) samples with squamous cell differentiation. When a well-established 90-gene expression assay was compared with the present classification, our methylation-based classification successfully classified two samples with no eligible RNA expression; the results for four sample were consistent with higher methylation prediction scores in three, and those for two samples were inconsistent. The methylation-based classification results of the remaining two samples were more compatible with the results of the clinical evaluation.\nCONCLUSION: We successfully established a DNA methylation-based classification for squamous cell carcinomas (lung, head and neck, esophagus, and cervix) and urothelial carcinomas with outstanding diagnostic performance for the first time.

Secondary outcomes included echocardiogram utilization rates, positive predictive value for low EF detection, and cardiology consultation rates. Statistical analysis included hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time-to-event outcomes and chi-square tests for categorical variables.\nRESULTS: The intervention significantly increased the detection of newly diagnosed low EF in the overall cohort (1.5% vs. 1.1%, HR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.11-2.03, P = 0.023), with a more pronounced effect among AI-identified high-risk patients (13.0% vs. 8.9%, HR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.08-2.21). While overall echocardiogram utilization remained similar between groups (17.1% vs. 17.3%, HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92-1.09), the intervention group demonstrated higher positive predictive value for identifying low EF among patients receiving echocardiogram (34.2% vs. 20.2%, p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed increased cardiology consultation rates among high-risk patients in the intervention group (29.3% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.027).\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an AI-ECG algorithm enhanced the early diagnosis of low EF in the inpatient setting, primarily by improving diagnostic efficiency rather than increasing overall healthcare utilization. The tool was particularly effective in identifying high-risk patients who benefited from increased specialist consultation and more targeted diagnostic testing.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05117970.", "authors": ["Tsai Dung-Jang", "Lin Chin", "Liu Wei-Ting", "Lee Chiao-Chin", "Chang Chiao-Hsiang", "Lin Wen-Yu", "Liu Yu-Lan", "Chang Da-Wei", "Hsieh Ping-Hsuan", "Tsai Chien-Sung", "Chen Yuan-Hao", "Hung Yi-Jen", "Lin Chin-Sheng"], "published_date": "2025-06-09", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "利用心電圖在住院部門中以人工智慧輔助診斷和預測低射血分數：一項實用性隨機對照試驗", "summary_zh": "這項研究在台灣的一家醫學中心進行，旨在評估利用心電圖（ECG）的人工智慧（AI）輔助臨床決策工具，能否提高非心臟科照護的住院病人早期診斷出低射血分數（EF）的比例。研究結果顯示，使用AI輔助診斷能顯著提高低射血分數的檢出率，尤其是在AI判斷為高風險的病人中效果更為明顯。雖然整體超音波心動圖的使用率沒有顯著差異，但AI輔助組在接受超音波檢查的病人中，檢測出低射血分數的陽性預測值更高。此外，高風險病人接受心臟科諮詢的比率也增加。結論是，導入AI心電圖演算法能加強住院病人早期診斷低射血分數，主要是透過提高診斷效率，而非增加整體醫療資源的使用。", "applications": ["想像一下，以後到醫院做心電圖，AI醫生會幫忙快速分析結果，就像多了一位專業的心臟科醫生在旁邊，能更快發現心臟功能異常的病人，及早治療。", "這項技術可以應用在偏鄉地區，讓沒有心臟科專家的醫院，也能透過AI心電圖，初步篩檢出心臟有問題的居民，再轉診到大醫院做進一步檢查。", "未來，我們或許可以在家裡用智慧手錶或穿戴裝置量心電圖，AI會自動分析數據，如果發現異常，就會提醒我們去看醫生，提早預防心臟疾病。"], "audio": "audios/40484925.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-09T09:19:29.854954"}

Of those, 51 with both baseline pre-infusion and one-month post-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CTs were included. 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters were derived, including standard uptake values (SUVs), metabolic tumour volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and Dmax. Additionally, the delta changes from the baseline were calculated. Time to progression/death was documented. For progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The significance of the difference was measured using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Significant parameters entered the multiple Cox regression.\nRESULTS: Overall, 51 patients (mean age = 56y) entered the study.

This scoping review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on the associations between tooth brushing behavior (as a proxy for oral hygiene) and major chronic health outcomes, including cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure), stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and subarachnoid), hypertension (HTN), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using four databases: Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. The study selection process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Two reviewers independently screened and selected eligible studies and extracted relevant data. A total of 142 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the final review. Most studies reported that a lower frequency of tooth brushing was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, stroke, HTN, MetS, and CKD. Additionally, several studies suggested that maintaining good oral hygiene in individuals with HTN or diabetes mellitus (DM) may be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular complications.\nCONCLUSION: Frequent tooth brushing, as a key component of oral hygiene, may be associated with a reduced risk of several chronic health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

The phase-separated morphology plays a pivotal role in determining the potential applications of blend thin films. As a guide to experimentalists, a machine learning-based classification framework is proposed that can predict the morphology of PS/PMMA blend thin films. Different experimental parameters like weight fraction of PS, molecular weight of PMMA, concentration, and substrate surface energy were used as inputs based on which the morphology type, i.e., column, hole, or island, was predicted using a multi-class classification model. Several machine learning algorithms were used to develop the proposed classifier. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm resulted in the highest accuracy of 93.75%. An explainable machine learning algorithm was also implemented to extract valuable insights from the proposed SVM model. These insights were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental observations, thus not only enhancing the reliability of the predictive model but also the understanding of phase separation in PS/PMMA blends. Based on these insights, several guidelines are recommended to further aid in the experimental design of specific morphologies.

Initially, Calibration mode identifies the catheter tip's three-dimensional coordinates using a fixed stack of contiguous slices. A U-Net architecture with a ResNet-34 encoder is used to identify the catheter tip location. Once identified, the sequence then switches to Runtime mode, dynamically acquiring three contiguous slices automatically centered on the catheter tip. The catheter location is estimated from each Runtime stack using the same network and fed back to the sequence, enabling prospective slice tracking to keep the catheter in the central slice. If the catheter remains unidentified over several dynamics, the sequence reverts to Calibration mode. This artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach was evaluated prospectively in a three-dimensional-printed heart phantom and 3 patients undergoing MR-guided cardiac catheterization. This technique was also compared retrospectively in 2 patients with a previous non-AI automatic tracking method relying on operator-defined parameters.\nRESULTS: In the phantom study, the tracking framework achieved 100% accuracy/sensitivity/specificity in both modes. Across all patients, the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity were 100 ± 0/100 ± 0/100 ± 0% (Calibration) and 98.4 ± 0.8/94.1 ± 2.9/100.0 ± 0.0% (Runtime).

The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), a surrogate marker of IR, may facilitate early LEAD risk stratification; however, its clinical utility remains underexplored.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of 7482 adults aged ≥50 years with T2DM, from the China DIA-LEAD study evaluated the association between eGDR (quartiles: Q1-Q4) and LEAD, defined by the ankle-brachial index (ABI <0.9 or >1.3). Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were used to assess the nonlinear relationships, adjusted for demographics, metabolic factors and comorbidities.\nRESULTS: Participants in the lower eGDR quartiles showed a progressively higher LEAD prevalence (Q1: 31.4% vs. Q4: 12.8%), worse glycaemic control (HbA1c Q1: 9.8% vs. Q4: 7.3%) and a greater comorbidity burden (all p < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, Q1 had a 2.23-fold higher LEAD risk versus Q4 (95% CI 1.47-3.37). Each 1-unit eGDR increase conferred a 24% lower LEAD risk (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.84). RCS analysis revealed an L-shaped relationship, with sharp risk escalation at eGDR < 8 mg/kg/min (p for nonlinearity = 0.003). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency across populations (all p for interaction >0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: eGDR demonstrated a significant inverse L-shaped association with LEAD in patients with T2DM.

The results showed that mTCR at environmentally relevant concentrations significantly activated prophages, promoting the spread of the ARGs. The activation mechanisms of shade- and photoaged mTCR differed, with eARGs carried by phage being more abundant in photoaged mTCR-treated sludge despite similar activation efficiencies. The random forests algorithm revealed that prophage activation induced by shade-aged mTCR was primarily driven by the metals and organic components leached from the mTCR. Antibiotic-resistant lysogens tolerated shade-aged mTCR due to their resistance to metals and organic matter, reducing internal prophage activation. In contrast, photoaged mTCR particles harbored more persistent free radicals, leading to the generation of extracellular O2•- and •OH, which damaged cell membranes and triggered prophage activation.

Prostate cancer with bone metastasis (PCa-BM) is the most common metastatic form of advanced prostate cancer in the elderly, significantly affecting prognosis and quality of life Although chemotherapy is commonly used for PCa-BM, the chronic inflammation it causes may exacerbate the risk of joint injuries to induce RA and related complications. Therefore, exploring the risk of chemotherapy-induced chronic inflammation on RA risk in PCa-BM patients holds critical importance.\nMETHODS: In vitro and in vivo experiments were used to evaluate the inflammatory response triggered by chemotherapy and its potential impact on RA in PCa-BM. Anti-inflammatory interventions were introduced to assess their effects on cytokine modulation. In vivo, the inflammatory and immunological alterations within the tumor microenvironment of PCa-BM were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Chemotherapy significantly activated inflammatory factors within the tumor microenvironment of PCa-BM. Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and p-STAT3, were observed. Anti-inflammatory intervention resulted in a significant reduction in these chronic inflammatory cytokines induced by chemotherapy, which were associated with RA.\nCONCLUSION: Combining anti-inflammatory therapy with chemotherapy effectively reduced inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment, which not only delayed tumor progression but also alleviated the chronic inflammatory injury on joints.

Few trials have tested the blood pressure-lowering effects of dietary interventions other than weight loss in this population.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of dietary patterns and sodium reduction on blood pressure in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension for Diabetes (DASH4D) was a randomized 4-period crossover feeding study conducted at a community-based study center from June 2021 to June 2024. It included adults with type 2 diabetes, a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 159 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. The DASH4D diet is a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet optimized for people with type 2 diabetes (lower carbohydrates, higher unsaturated fats, and lower potassium than the original DASH diet). Participants were provided all of their food and ate no outside food. Weight was held constant. Data analysis was completed in November 2024.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a sequence of 4 diets, each for 5 weeks: (1) DASH4D diet with lower sodium, (2) DASH4D diet with higher sodium, (3) comparison (typical US) diet with lower sodium, and (4) comparison diet with higher sodium (reference).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary and secondary outcomes were end-of-period systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. The primary dietary contrast compared the DASH4D lower sodium diet vs a comparison higher sodium diet.\nRESULTS: Of 102 participants, 85 (83.3%) completed all diet periods. The mean (SD) age was 66 (8.8) years, 67 (66%) were women, 6 (6%) were self-reported Asian, 89 (87%) were Black, 2 (2%) were Hispanic, 6 (6%) were White, mean (SD) baseline blood pressure was 135 (9)/75 (9) mm Hg, and 67 (66%) used 2 or more antihypertensive medications. Compared with the comparison diet with higher sodium, the DASH4D diet with lower sodium reduced end-of-period systolic blood pressure by 4.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 7.2-2.0; P < .001) and diastolic blood pressure by 2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, 3.7-0.9). Most blood pressure reduction occurred during the first 3 weeks of each diet, and the effect of sodium reduction appeared stronger than the effect of the DASH4D diet. Adverse events were infrequent in each diet.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that, for adults with type 2 diabetes, most of whom were treated with multiple antihypertensive medications, the DASH4D diet combined with sodium reduction achieved a clinically relevant reduction in blood pressure, primarily from sodium reduction.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04286555.", "authors": ["Pilla Scott J", "Yeh Hsin-Chieh", "Mitchell Christine M", "Miller Edgar R", "Oh Susan", "White Karen", "Durkin Nowella", "Stein Ariella A", "Charleston Jeanne B", "Lu Mengyang", "Hu Xiao", "Wu Beiwen", "Selvin Elizabeth", "Fang Michael", "Maruthur Nisa M", "Juraschek Stephen P", "Mueller Noel T", "Wang Nae-Yuh", "Appel Lawrence J"], "published_date": "2025-06-09", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "第二型糖尿病患的飲食模式、鈉攝取量減少與血壓：DASH4D 隨機臨床試驗", "summary_zh": "這項研究針對第二型糖尿病且患有高血壓的成年人，探討飲食模式和減少鈉攝取量對血壓的影響。研究採用隨機交叉試驗，讓受試者輪流接受四種飲食：低鈉DASH4D飲食、高鈉DASH4D飲食、低鈉美式飲食和高鈉美式飲食。DASH4D飲食是針對糖尿病患者優化的DASH飲食，降低碳水化合物、提高不飽和脂肪，並減少鉀含量。結果顯示，相較於高鈉美式飲食，低鈉DASH4D飲食能有效降低收縮壓和舒張壓，且鈉攝取量減少的效果似乎比DASH4D飲食本身更為顯著。這項研究表明，對於第二型糖尿病患者，結合DASH4D飲食和減少鈉攝取量，可以達到顯著的血壓降低效果。", "applications": ["慢性病管理App：將DASH4D飲食原則和低鈉飲食建議整合到App中，幫助糖尿病高血壓患者追蹤飲食、控制血壓，並提供個人化的健康建議。", "健康餐飲服務：針對糖尿病高血壓患者設計符合DASH4D飲食原則的餐點，提供低鈉、低碳水化合物、高不飽和脂肪的健康餐飲選擇，方便外食族也能輕鬆控制飲食。", "社區健康講座：舉辦講座向民眾宣導DASH4D飲食和低鈉飲食的重要性，教導民眾如何在家中烹調健康餐點，並提供實用的飲食技巧和食譜，幫助民眾改善飲食習慣，降低血壓。"], "audio": "audios/40489102.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-09T18:25:22.724822"}

This study conducted comprehensive experiments on 12 models, aiming to establish reliable benchmarks for research on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging image classification. Twelve deep learning models were systematically compared by analyzing variations in 4 key hyperparameters: optimizer (Op), learning rate, batch size (BS), and data augmentation. The evaluation criteria encompassed a comprehensive set of metrics including accuracy (Ac), loss value, precision, recall rate, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Furthermore, the training times and model parameter counts were assessed for holistic performance comparison. Adjustments in the BS within Adam Op had a minimal impact on Ac in the convolutional neural network models. However, altering the Op and learning rate while maintaining the same BS significantly affected the Ac. The ResNet152 network model exhibited the lowest Ac. Both the recall rate and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the ResNet152 and Vision transformer-base (ViT) models were inferior compared to the others. Data augmentation unexpectedly reduced the Ac of ResNet50, ResNet152, VGG16, VGG19, and ViT models. The VGG16 model boasted the shortest training duration, whereas the ViT model, before data augmentation, had the longest training time and smallest model weight.

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models such as ChatGPT, offers new opportunities for simplifying medical documentation to improve patient comprehension.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether AI-generated radiology reports simplified by ChatGPT improve patient understanding, readability, and communication quality compared to original AI-generated reports.\nMETHODS: In total, 3 versions of radiology reports were created using ChatGPT: an original AI-generated version (text 1), a patient-friendly, simplified version (text 2), and a further simplified and accessibility-optimized version (text 3). A total of 300 patients (n=100, 33.3% per group), excluding patients with medical education, were randomly assigned to review one text version and complete a standardized questionnaire. Readability was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score and LIX indices.\nRESULTS: Both simplified texts showed significantly higher readability scores (text 1: FRE score=51.1; text 2: FRE score=55.0; and text 3: FRE score=56.4; P<.001) and lower LIX scores, indicating enhanced clarity.

Excluded were individuals with genitourinary issues, prostate surgery history, urostomy, cognitive impairment, mental illness, chronic indwelling catheter requirements, hemodialysis, or undergoing interventional surgery. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics were collected to perform multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for urinary catheter reinsertion. In our study of 254 cardiac surgery patients, 21 (8.26%) required urinary catheter reinsertion. Notable differences were not seen in age, gender, or body mass index between the reinsertion and no reinsertion groups. However, diabetes was significantly more prevalent in the reinsertion group (19%) compared to the no reinsertion group (3%) (P = .001), with diabetic patients also experiencing longer operative times and older age. The median urinary catheter duration was significantly shorter in the reinsertion group (35.03 hours) versus 60.65 hours for those without reinsertion (P = .034).

Multivariable logistic regression highlighted key risk factors: each additional year of age increased reinsertion risk by 3.6% (OR = 1.036, P = .023), and diabetic patients were approximately 8.8 times more likely to require reinsertion (OR = 8.755, P = .004). Early catheter removal was associated with an 8.6-fold increase in reinsertion likelihood (OR = 8.570, P = .001). Our findings emphasize the need for personalized management strategies to prevent urinary catheter reinsertion in cardiac surgery patients, particularly among older individuals, those with diabetes, or whose catheters are removed early post-surgery.

Despite increasing recognition of LLMs, insights on the utilities, associated benefits and limitations are scarce among perioperative clinicians. In this narrative review, we delve into the functionalities and prospects of existing LLMs and their clinical application in perioperative medicine.

This work addresses these issues by proposing a novel robotic ultrasound tracking system capable of long-distance 3D tracking and active re-localization when the capsule is lost due to motion or artifacts.\nMETHODS: We develop a hybrid deep learning-based tracking framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a transformer backbone. The CNN component efficiently encodes spatial features, while the transformer captures long-range contextual dependencies in B-mode US images. This model is integrated with a robotic arm that adaptively scans and tracks the capsule. The system's performance is evaluated using ex vivo colon phantoms under varying imaging conditions, with physical perturbations introduced to simulate realistic clinical scenarios.\nRESULTS: The proposed system achieved continuous 3D tracking over distances exceeding 90 cm, with a mean centroid localization error of 1.5 mm and over 90% detection accuracy. We demonstrated 3D tracking in a more complex workspace featuring two curved sections to simulate anatomical challenges. This suggests the strong resilience of the tracking system to motion-induced artifacts and geometric variability. The system maintained real-time tracking at 9-12 FPS and successfully re-localized the capsule within seconds after tracking loss, even under gas artifacts and acoustic shadowing.\nCONCLUSION: This study presents a hybrid CNN-transformer system for automatic, real-time 3D ultrasound tracking of capsule robots over long distances. The method reliably handles occlusions, view loss and image artifacts, offering millimeter-level tracking accuracy. It significantly reduces clinical workload through autonomous detection and re-localization.

The adapted instrument underwent cognitive testing and refinements to ensure it could capture the burden of using digital medicine tools in the self-management and care of diabetes.\nMETHODS: This two-phase study was conducted with adults with diabetes and other chronic conditions at the Division of Endocrinology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. First, we mapped themes from prior concept elicitation interviews to existing TBQ items to identify content gaps related to digital burden. Based on these gaps, the study team and expert panel followed an item development guide to generate new items and adapt existing ones to better reflect the workload and burdens imposed by digital medicine tools. The resulting adapted instrument underwent three rounds of cognitive testing with adult patients living with diabetes, using a think-aloud protocol to assess clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness.

Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors, alongside selective pharmacotherapies, appears to enhance ablation success, yet optimal strategies remain under exploration.

To ensure fair comparison of prediction performance, data were randomly divided. The second, the WVU cohort containing 62 patients, was used as an independent test set for validation and simulation of a real-world scenario. Six key ENE-related variables (predictors) were selected based on importance and data availability.\nRESULTS: The generalizability of the ML models was validated using real data from our institute with an average AUC ROC of 0.74. Of all the models, AdaBoost had reasonable performance: precision of 72%, NPV of 0.74%, specificity of 0.81, AUC ROC of 0.74. Similarly, the XGBOOST and ensemble models demonstrated the strongest combination of sensitivity and precision, critical for correctly predicting ENE, with AUC ROC ranging from 0.71 to 0.75.

Despite insulin's proven efficacy, adherence remains a significant challenge. This study aims to identify factors influencing insulin adherence among patients with T2D to inform targeted clinical interventions.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary diabetes clinic, recruiting adult patients with T2D on insulin therapy for at least six months. A structured, validated questionnaire was administered in person to collect demographic, clinical, and treatment-related data, along with patient beliefs about insulin. Insulin adherence was defined as taking ≥80% of prescribed doses over the past month. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of adherence.\nRESULTS: Among 111 patients, 49 (44.1%) were adherent, while 62 (55.9%) were non-adherent. Adherence was associated with male gender, higher education levels, smoking abstinence, and adherence to recommended diet and exercise regimens. Non-adherent patients had a higher prevalence of family history of diabetes, more diabetic complications, increased comorbidities, and more frequent hospitalizations.

The complex pathophysiology of MMP poses substantial diagnostic and management challenges. Currently, delayed diagnosis remains a critical contributor to poor outcomes because of the absence of reliable individualized risk assessment tools.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a deep learning-based model that integrates multimodal data to identify patients with AAD at high risk of MMP.\nMETHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 525 patients with AAD from 2 hospitals. The training and internal validation cohort consisted of 450 patients from Beijing Anzhen Hospital, whereas the external validation cohort comprised 75 patients from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Three machine learning models were developed: the benchmark model using laboratory parameters, the multiorgan feature-based AAD complicating MMP (MAM) model based on computed tomography angiography images, and the integrated model combining both data modalities. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Brier score. To improve interpretability, gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to identify and visualize discriminative imaging features. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the risk score generated by the optimal model.\nRESULTS: In the external validation cohort, the integrated model demonstrated superior performance, with an area under the curve of 0.780 (95% CI 0.777-0.785), which was significantly greater than those of the benchmark model (0.586, 95% CI 0.574-0.586) and the MAM model (0.732, 95% CI 0.724-0.734). This highlights the benefits of multimodal integration over single-modality approaches. Additional classification metrics revealed that the integrated model had an accuracy of 0.760 (95% CI 0.758-0.764), a sensitivity of 0.667 (95% CI 0.659-0.675), a specificity of 0.783 (95% CI 0.781-0.788), and a Brier score of 0.143 (95% CI 0.143-0.145). Moreover, gradient-weighted class activation mapping visualizations of the MAM model revealed that during positive predictions, the model focused more on key anatomical areas, particularly the superior mesenteric artery origin and intestinal regions with characteristic gas or fluid accumulation. Univariate and multivariate analyses also revealed that the risk score derived from the integrated model was independently associated with inhospital mortality risk among patients with AAD undergoing endovascular or surgical treatment (odds ratio 1.030, 95% CI 1.004-1.056; P=.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that compared with unimodal approaches, an integrated deep learning model incorporating both imaging and clinical data has greater diagnostic accuracy for MMP in patients with AAD.

This study aimed to (1) create a dataset aggregating retraction information with bibliographic metadata, (2) train and evaluate various machine learning approaches to predict article retractions, and (3) assess each feature's contribution to feature-based classifier performance using ablation studies.\nMETHODS: An open-access dataset was developed by combining information from the Retraction Watch database and the OpenAlex API. Using a case-controlled design, retracted research articles were paired with non-retracted articles published in the same period. Traditional feature-based classifiers and models leveraging contextual language representations were then trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.\nRESULTS: The Llama 3.2 base model achieved the highest overall accuracy. The Random Forest classifier achieved a precision of 0.687 for identifying non-retracted articles, while the Llama 3.2 base model reached a precision of 0.683 for identifying retracted articles. Traditional feature-based classifiers generally outperformed most contextual language models, except for the Llama 3.2 base model, which showed competitive performance across several metrics.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although no single model excelled across all metrics, our findings indicate that machine learning techniques can effectively support the identification of retracted research.

Notably, only older mosquitoes can transmit these diseases. Therefore, accurate age estimation of mosquitoes is vital for targeted interventions and risk assessments. However, traditional methods, such as tracheole morphology analysis, are labor-intensive and have limited scalability. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), when coupled with artificial neural networks (ANNs), offers a robust and flexible alternative, facilitating accurate and efficient mosquito age determination even in diverse and complex environmental conditions.\nMETHODS: We analyzed 124 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from California (CA) and Thailand (TH) using SERS, each generating 20 spectra. The ANNs utilized a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers of 100 neurons and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. Classification tasks used cross-entropy loss; regression applied mean squared error. Models were trained with a 70-30 training-validation split and optimized using the Adam optimizer over 10,000 iterations. Performance metrics included accuracy, correlation coefficient (R), and root mean square error (RMSE). t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualizations and confusion matrices offered additional model insights into effectiveness.\nRESULTS: The ANN models demonstrated superior performance in differentiating mosquito age relative to non-ANN methods. For female CA mosquitoes, the models classified ages from day 1 to day 21 with 84% accuracy and predicted age with an R of 0.96 and RMSE of 2.18 days. Similarly, the models achieved 86% accuracy and an R-value of 0.95 for female TH mosquitoes. While mosquito origin and sex influenced performance, the combined model maintained robust results, achieving 80% accuracy and an R-value of 0.93. Implementing a voting mechanism across multiple spectra for each mosquito significantly improved accuracy, increasing classification performance from approximately 80% at the spectrum level to 100% at the mosquito level.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of SERS combined with ANN for accurate age classification and prediction of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

Several barriers may hamper the achievement of good glycaemic control, which is the aim of diabetes care.

Diabetes self-management is critical, particularly in insulin-treated patients and it is largely based on glucose monitoring, which allows recording glucose levels to make informed decisions with respect to meals, exercise, and other daily-life activities. For decades, glucose monitoring has been based on self-measurement of capillary blood glucose, which has some obvious important limitations. With the start of the new century, systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have become available. These systems measure subcutaneous interstitial glucose levels in a continuous or intermittent manner. They allow a better description of daily glucose pattern and glycaemic trend, a more accurate identification of glucose peaks and identification of otherwise unrecognised hypoglycaemic episodes, and a more reliable assessment of the stability of glycaemic control.

With a prevalence of approximately 1-2% and a male predominance, these cysts most commonly occur in the Sylvian fissure and posterior fossa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) serves as the gold standard for diagnosis, with diffusion-weighted imaging and cine phase-contrast MRI playing critical roles in differentiating communicating versus non-communicating cyst types and assessing CSF dynamics. Asymptomatic cysts are typically managed conservatively with periodic neuroimaging follow-up, while surgical intervention is reserved for symptomatic cases, particularly those associated with hydrocephalus, seizures, or focal neurological deficits.

To address this, this study proposed a multimodal learning (MML)-based framework for predicting effluent water quality and toxicity in WWTPs. Representation fusion and decision fusion strategies were adopted to optimize the MML models' performance. Additionally, a novel 3C-Encoding strategy was proposed to tackle the challenges of encoding process information. The results demonstrated that MML models achieved significant improvements over traditional methods (R2 increase ranging from 0.057 to 0.234).

Early prognosis of esophageal abnormalities can improve patient survival rates. The progression of esophageal cancer follows a sequence from esophagitis to non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, and eventually esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). This study explored the application of deep learning technology in the precise diagnosis of pathological classification and staging of EAC to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.\nAIM: To explore the application of deep learning models, particularly Wave-Vision Transformer (Wave-ViT), in the pathological classification and staging of esophageal cancer to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.\nMETHODS: We applied several deep learning models, including multi-layer perceptron, residual network, transformer, and Wave-ViT, to a dataset of clinically validated esophageal pathology images. The models were trained to identify pathological features and assist in the classification and staging of different stages of esophageal cancer. The models were compared based on accuracy, computational complexity, and efficiency.\nRESULTS: The Wave-ViT model demonstrated the highest accuracy at 88.97%, surpassing the transformer (87.65%), residual network (85.44%), and multi-layer perceptron (81.17%). Additionally, Wave-ViT exhibited low computational complexity with significantly reduced parameter size, making it highly efficient for real-time clinical applications.\nCONCLUSION: Deep learning technology, particularly the Frequency-Domain Transformer model, shows promise in improving the precision of pathological classification and staging of EAC.

While bariatric surgery has established itself as the most effective long-term treatment for severe obesity, delivering consistent weight loss and notable improvements in obesity-related comorbidities, its utilization remains relatively low due to factors such as patient apprehension, access disparities, and insurance limitations. The recent emergence and widespread adoption of potent anti-obesity medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide and dual incretin agonists such as tirzepatide, have created new, non-surgical pathways capable of achieving substantial weight loss outcomes, thus prompting a reevaluation of the traditional obesity treatment landscape. This comprehensive review assesses the contemporary state of bariatric surgery and systematically examines the clinical efficacy, safety, and durability of emerging pharmacotherapies relative to surgical interventions. We also analyze the potential implications of these medications on patient preferences, surgical volumes, healthcare economics, and the bariatric surgery job market within the United States. Recognizing the evolving role of bariatric surgeons, we discuss how the profession may adapt through multidisciplinary care models, integrated pharmacological management, and adjusted surgical training programs.

Using the RAG-enabled generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model, we developed a novel class-based risk stratification system that assigned point values for risk factors, culminating in a GPT-based prognostication system called the artificial intelligence-derived risk score (AIRIS). The system's performance was validated on a combined prospective and retrospective cohort of 2379 primary cSCC tumors (1996-2023) with at least 36 months of follow-up, against Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition (AJCC8) systems in stratifying risk for locoregional recurrence (LR), nodal metastasis (NM), distant metastasis (DM), and disease-specific death (DSD).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance metrics evaluated included distinctiveness, homogeneity, and monotonicity, as defined by the AJCC8, as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and concordance.\nRESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 73 (IQR, 64-81) years, with 38.5% female patients and 61.5% male patients. The AIRIS prognostication system demonstrated superior sensitivity across all outcomes (LR, 49.1%; NM, 73.7%; DM, 82.5%; and DSD, 72.2%) and the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (LR, 0.69; NM, 0.81; DM, 0.85; and DSD, 0.80), indicating significantly enhanced discriminative capability compared with the BWH and AJCC8 systems.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is susceptible to misdiagnosis by DL models due to distribution shifts. This work demonstrates the potential of continual learning (CL) to enhance model performance in MetS identification across diverse settings.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized 3 healthcare datasets from 2 distinct settings: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC; from a hospital setting), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and a proprietary dataset (both from non-hospital settings). We proposed a robust MetS identification pipeline with CL strategies and evaluated its effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining high predictive performance under distribution shift.\nRESULTS: The CL method outperformed the control (sequential training without any strategies) method.

Black patients (219 338 [9.2%]) were slightly younger than White patients (2 156 962 [90.8%]; mean [SD] age, 75.8 [7.9] years vs 76.9 [7.8] years; P < .001) and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. A higher proportion of Black patients (8.9%) than White patients (7.6%) underwent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.18-1.21]; P < .001), and a higher proportion of Black patients (2.8%) than White patients (1.0%) underwent major amputation (odds ratio, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.83-2.99]; P < .001). Higher proportions of Black patients than White patients underwent revascularization and major amputation in the majority of states, although with marked variation in these proportional differences across states. The proportions of Black and White patients who underwent revascularization decreased over time (from 8.0% to 7.4% for Black patients and from 6.8% to 6.2% for White patients). The proportion of Black patients who underwent major amputation decreased (from 2.9% to 2.5%; P < .001), but there was no change among White patients (from 0.7% to 0.7%; P = .53). Revascularization correlated weakly (ρ = 0.10), and amputation correlated moderately with SVI (ρ = 0.46).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that higher proportions of Black patients than White patients undergo invasive procedures for PAD, with considerable variation across states. Although the proportional difference in major amputations has narrowed over time, the persistent proportional excess of major amputations among Black patients requires further study to investigate whether this difference reflects remediable disparities in care.", "authors": ["Vogel Birgit", "Dangas Katerina", "Di Muro Francesca Maria", "Sartori Samantha", "Oliva Angelo", "Dangas George", "Krishnan Prakash", "Yoon Harrison", "Etter Katherine", "Erim Daniel", "Pylypchuk Yuriy", "Keever Rachel", "Mehran Roxana"], "published_date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "Medicare受益人周邊動脈疾病治療的種族時間與地域趨勢分析", "summary_zh": "本研究分析了2018至2022年間，美國Medicare受益人中，黑人和白人在周邊動脈疾病（PAD）治療上的差異。研究發現，黑人患者接受血管重建和重大截肢的比例顯著高於白人患者，且各州之間存在明顯差異。雖然隨著時間推移，黑人患者的截肢比例有所下降，但仍明顯高於白人患者。研究結果提示，黑人患者在PAD治療中可能面臨潛在的醫療資源不平等問題。社經弱勢程度與截肢率呈現中度相關。未來需要更深入的研究，以探討這些差異是否反映了可改善的醫療照護差距，並針對高風險地區和族群制定更有效的干預措施。", "applications": ["【健康政策制定】：政府可以根據研究結果，針對黑人族群在周邊動脈疾病治療上可能面臨的醫療資源不平等問題，制定更完善的健康政策，例如增加對弱勢地區醫療機構的補助，或加強對黑人族群的健康教育，提高其對周邊動脈疾病的預防意識。", "【臨床醫療改善】：醫療機構可以參考研究中各州之間的差異，學習在周邊動脈疾病治療上做得較好的州的經驗，改善自身的臨床醫療流程，例如加強早期診斷和介入治療，減少不必要的截肢手術。同時，也應關注患者的社經背景，提供更全面的醫療照護。", "【公眾健康教育】：透過簡單易懂的宣導方式，讓民眾了解周邊動脈疾病的風險因素和預防方法，特別是針對黑人族群，加強對糖尿病、高血壓等疾病的控制，並鼓勵定期檢查，及早發現和治療周邊動脈疾病。"], "audio": "audios/40498478.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-11T18:24:36.960120"}

Models such as decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and DLNN were trained, with DLNN evaluated using cross-validation metrics. To address class imbalance, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed.

Plasma cfDNA methylation has been shown to have the potential to be a non-invasive method for diagnosing HCC. However, the identified HCC plasma cfDNA methylation sites were less sensitive to early HCC diagnosis. Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive marker panel based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation for the detection of HCC.\nMETHODS: The study included 374 participants, including 102 healthy individuals, 51 HBV patients, 50 cirrhosis patients, and 171 HCC patients (56 at stage 0 or A according to BCLC staging). Two cfDNA methylation sequencing assays (whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS)) were used along with machine learning modeling to detect HBV-related HCC based on differentially methylated regions (DMR) among the four participant groups.\nRESULTS: TBS analysis achieved an overall sensitivity of 96.67% at a specificity of 93.7% than alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of 18%-60%, to discriminate all stages of HCC patients from healthy people, and sensitivity of 90.0% at a specificity of 93.75% to discriminate early-stage HCC patients from healthy people. A number of significant DMRs between HCC and non-cancer groups were identified, providing candidate biomarkers for HCC detection. Among these DMRs, one that locates in the promoter region of GJA4, was found to be consistently present in the whole process of HBV-related HCC carcinogenesis. Using data from TCGA, comparison of expression profile of GJA4 between 160 healthy people and 369 HCC patients further supported this scenario.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides biomarkers for detecting, staging and early detection of HCC using plasma cfDNA methylome profiling.

The development of a germline genetic test, or polygenic risk score, to identify women at high risk of breast cancer holds the potential to reduce cancer deaths. However, current tests based on SNPs do not perform much better than predictions based on family history and perform significantly worse in populations with non-European ancestry. We have developed an alternative method to characterize a genome, called chromosomal-scale length variation, which can be applied to polygenic risk scores.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to characterize a breast cancer genetic risk score based on chromosomal-scale length variation using the NIH All of Us dataset in different self-identified racial groups when trained on different populations.\nMETHODS: We used the NIH All of Us dataset to compile a dataset with 4,533 women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer (including 440 who self-identified as Black) and 44,518 women who have not. We acquired, through All of Us, genetic information for each of these women. We computed a set of 88 values for each woman in the dataset, representing the chromosomal-scale length variation parameters. These numbers are average log R ratios for four different segments from each of the 22 autosomes. We used machine learning algorithms to find a model that best differentiates the women with breast cancer from the women without breast cancer based on the set of 88 numbers that characterize each woman's germline genome.\nRESULTS: The best model had an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.67-0.73) in the All of Us population. Women who scored in the top quintile by this model were nine times more likely to have breast cancer when compared to women who scored in the lowest quintile.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that this method of computing genetic risk scores for breast cancer is a substantial improvement over SNP-based polygenic risk scores. In addition, we compared models trained on populations of only White women and only Black women. We found that the models trained only on White women performed better than models trained only on Black women when tested on only White women.

PFO was detected in 749(5.4%), and these were younger, and had a lower prevalence of risk factors than patients without PFO (all p value < 0.05). After adjusting for age and sex, PFO diagnoses increased by 59% following the guidelines update. Five-year recurrence was 12.1% [95%CI 11.3-12.9] with no differences by age and PFO. Socioeconomical status and diabetes emerged as predictors of recurrence. Stroke patients with PFO showed a lower mortality rate (p value = 0.016). However, when stratified by age, PFO was linked to lower 4-year mortality only in patients ≤ 50 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirm a greater detection of PFO in real-world practice following the update of guidelines. Regarding the risk of recurrence, socioeconomic status and diabetes were the only independent predictors of new stroke events. Additionally, we found a lower all-cause mortality in younger patients with PFO.", "authors": ["Giralt-Steinhauer Eva", "Cuadrado-Godia Elisa", "Rodriguez-Campello Ana", "Fernández-Pérez Isabel", "Guisado-Alonso Daniel", "Macias-Gómez Adrià", "Vallverdú-Prats Marta", "Peris-Subiza Julia", "Vidal-Notari Sergio", "Ble-Gimeno Mireia", "Jiménez-Conde Jordi", "Ois Angel", "Jiménez-Balado Joan"], "published_date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "年輕中風患者的卵圓孔未閉診斷：復發與死亡率分析", "summary_zh": "這項研究分析了2016至2021年間，加泰隆尼亞地區18至60歲的缺血性中風患者，探討卵圓孔未閉（PFO）診斷與中風復發和死亡率之間的關係。研究發現，在2018年歐洲中風組織更新指南後，PFO的檢出率顯著提升了59%。總體而言，PFO患者的死亡率較低，尤其是在50歲以下的年輕患者中。然而，中風復發的風險主要與社經地位和糖尿病有關，與PFO無明顯關聯。這項研究強調了早期檢測PFO的重要性，並提醒我們關注社經地位和糖尿病對中風復發的影響。", "applications": ["情境一：健康檢查時，醫生可以根據這項研究，更積極地建議年輕中風患者進行PFO篩檢，以便及早發現並治療，降低未來再次中風的風險。", "情境二：醫院在制定中風防治策略時，除了關注PFO，也要同時考量患者的社經背景和糖尿病控制情況，提供更全面的醫療照護。", "情境三：一般民眾可以透過這項研究了解，年輕型中風可能與卵圓孔未閉有關，如果出現中風症狀，應盡快就醫檢查，及早診斷與治療，同時也要注意控制血糖，維持健康的生活型態。"], "audio": "audios/40500465.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-12T09:18:57.512301"}

Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have achieved notable success in this domain but often lack interpretability which is a crucial requirement in clinical settings. In this study, we explore the use of neuro-symbolic methods, specifically Logical Neural Networks (LNNs), to develop explainable models for diagnosis prediction. Essentially, we design and implement LNN-based models that integrate domain-specific knowledge through logical rules with learnable weights and thresholds. Our models, particularly Mmulti-pathway and Mcomprehensive, demonstrate superior performance over traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80.52%) and AUROC scores (up to 0.8457) in the case study of diabetes prediction. The learned weights and thresholds within the LNN models provide direct insights into feature contributions, enhancing interpretability without compromising predictive power. These findings highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches in bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in healthcare AI applications.

However, the clinical impact of these models remains largely unrealized.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of an AI-guided infection prevention bundle with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) incidence in a hospital setting.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, single-center quality improvement study evaluated adult inpatient hospitalizations before (September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2022) and after (January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023) AI implementation. Data analysis was performed from January to August 2024.\nINTERVENTION: A previously validated institution-specific AI model for CDI risk prediction was integrated into clinical workflows at the study site. The model was used to guide infection prevention practices for reducing pathogen exposure through enhanced hand hygiene and reducing host susceptibility through antimicrobial stewardship.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was CDI incidence rate. Secondary outcomes included antimicrobial use and qualitative assessments of bundle implementation.\nRESULTS: Pre-AI and post-AI samples included 39 046 (21 645 [55.4%] female; median [IQR] age, 58 [36-70] years) and 40 515 (22 575 [55.7%] female; median [IQR] age, 58 [37-70] years) hospitalizations, respectively. After adjusting for differences in clinical characteristics, there was no significant reduction in CDI incidence (pre-AI period: 5.76 per 10 000 patient-days vs post-AI period: 5.65 per 10 000 patient-days; absolute difference, -0.11; 95% CI, -1.43 to 1.18; P = .85). Relative reductions greater than 10% in normalized antimicrobial days were seen for piperacillin-tazobactam (-9.64; 95% CI, -12.93 to -6.28; P < .001) and clindamycin (-1.04; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.47; P = .03), especially for high-risk patients alerted by AI (relative reduction for piperacillin-tazobactam, 16.8%; 95% CI, 8.0%-24.6%). On the basis of qualitative assessments via semistructured interviews and field observations, the study found that health care staff's experiences with AI-guided workflows varied. In particular, the enhanced hand hygiene protocols were met with poor adherence, whereas pharmacists consistently engaged with the alerts.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quality improvement study, the implementation of an AI-guided infection prevention bundle was not associated with a significant reduction in the already low CDI incidence rate at the study site, but it was associated with reduced CDI-associated antimicrobial use.

Differential expression analysis identified 293 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Twelve ML algorithms (including Stepglm, glmBoost, and RF) were systematically combined into 113 distinct models to classify NPC versus normal tissues. Top-performing models underwent external validation. Immune infiltration patterns and functional enrichment were analyzed using CIBERSORT and GSEA/GSVA, respectively.\nRESULTS: The Stepglm[both]-RF hybrid model demonstrated exceptional performance with AUCs of 0.999 (training set; 95% CI: 0.997-1.000), 1.000 (GSE61218/GSE34573 validation), and 0.960 (GSE13597 validation).

Therefore, the standard of care was approved primarily based on the results of single-arm phase II trials.

Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for metastatic and recurrent diseases.\nAREAS COVERED: This review delineates the distinct difference in treatment strategies of chemotherapy in patients with thymomas and thymic carcinomas. Thymomas typically respond to a cisplatin and anthracyclines, often supplemented with steroids, whereas thymic carcinomas, which do not typically involve anthracyclines as key drugs, are treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Lenvatinib has emerged as a pivotal key drug for refractory thymic carcinoma. In addition, single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors is considered as key drugs for thymic carcinomas.\nEXPERT OPINION: Current research is focused on developing novel therapeutics such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), angiogenesis inhibitors, multi-kinase inhibitors, and further immune checkpoint inhibitors, expanding the prospects for pharmacotherapy in thymic malignancies.", "authors": ["Masui Yoshihiro", "Okuma Yusuke"], "published_date": "2025-06-12", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "轉移性胸腺瘤和胸腺癌的治療選擇更新", "summary_zh": "胸腺上皮腫瘤是一種罕見癌症，起源於胸腺。如果腫瘤可以切除且是局部性的，應考慮手術、放療和藥物治療相結合的綜合治療。對於轉移性和復發性疾病，藥物治療是主要手段。胸腺瘤通常對順鉑和蒽環類藥物有反應，通常輔以類固醇。胸腺癌則使用以鉑類為基礎的雙藥化療，通常不包括蒽環類藥物。Lenvatinib已成為難治性胸腺癌的關鍵藥物。此外，單藥細胞毒性化療、分子靶向治療和免疫檢查點抑制劑也被認為是胸腺癌的關鍵藥物。目前的研究重點是開發新型療法，如抗體藥物偶聯物（ADCs）、血管生成抑制劑、多激酶抑制劑和更多的免疫檢查點抑制劑，擴大胸腺惡性腫瘤的藥物治療前景。", "applications": ["情境一：針對胸腺癌患者，這項研究能幫助醫生更精準地選擇化療藥物，像是如果傳統化療效果不好，可以考慮使用Lenvatinib這種新藥，提高治療成功的機會。", "情境二：對於罕見的胸腺瘤，這項研究提醒醫生，即使是同為胸腺腫瘤，胸腺瘤和胸腺癌的治療方式也不同，選擇正確的藥物組合非常重要，避免用錯藥。", "情境三：研究人員可以根據這篇文獻，了解目前胸腺癌治療的最新趨勢，例如正在開發的新型藥物，像是抗體藥物偶聯物，這有助於他們設計出更有效的治療方案。"], "audio": "audios/40504606.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-12T21:16:49.228608"}

While high compression (>40mmHg) is the gold standard, delays in vascular assessment often postpone the adapted treatment. The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is recommended to exclude peripheral arterial disease, but its availability and reliability may vary, particularly in patients with diabetes. Given these challenges, immediate mild compression (≤20mmHg) has been proposed as a first and safe interim approach before confirming venous aetiology through an assessment performed by a vascular physician. Studies show that mild compression prevents worsening venous hypertension and improves patient adherence compared to stronger compression. In this position paper, written by a group of expert physicians in the field of compression therapy, we propose a pragmatic approach to compression during the initial phase of leg ulcer management to optimise patient care and wound healing outcomes. Guidelines support early mild compression in the absence of arterial 'red flags' (most notably chronic limb-threatening ischaemia, CLTI), followed by an increase in compression once venous pathology is confirmed. In France, where only 6.5% of general practitioners perform ABPI, timely vascular assessment is often impractical, leading to delayed interventions. After clinical elimination of any contraindication(s) (such as CLTI, severe neuropathy and/or atypical ulcers with a lack of healing despite hypergranulation), an effective strategy should involve the immediate initiation of mild compression, conducting vascular assessment within 4-6 weeks, and transitioning to high compression if needed and if the patient is able to tolerate it. Hence, mild compression can also be beneficial for patients who do not tolerate high compression. Given the need to balance safety, efficacy and tolerance, mild compression can be a valuable first-line strategy before specialised intervention, and while waiting for ABPI measurement availability as part of a complete vascular assessment.", "authors": ["Blaise Sophie", "Senet Patricia", "Meaume Sylvie", "Geri Chloé", "Malloizel Julie", "Howaldt Monira Nou"], "published_date": "2025-06-02", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "社區環境下腿部潰瘍的初步管理：針對家庭醫生的新算法建議", "summary_zh": "靜脈性腿部潰瘍影響已開發國家1%的人口，造成嚴重的公共衛生負擔。高壓迫療法是黃金標準，但血管評估延遲常導致治療延後。踝肱指數(ABPI)雖建議用於排除周邊動脈疾病，但其可用性和可靠性因人而異，特別是糖尿病患者。因此，在血管專科醫師確認靜脈病因前，先採用溫和壓迫（≤20mmHg）作為安全的第一步。研究顯示，溫和壓迫可預防靜脈高壓惡化，並提高患者依從性。本文由壓迫治療專家撰寫，提出腿部潰瘍初步管理的務實壓迫方法，以優化患者護理和傷口癒合。指南支持在排除動脈危險信號（如慢性肢體威脅性缺血）後，早期使用溫和壓迫，確認靜脈病變後再增加壓迫。在法國，僅6.5%的家庭醫生進行ABPI檢查，及時血管評估往往不切實際，導致干預延遲。有效的策略應包括立即開始溫和壓迫，4-6週內進行血管評估，並在需要時轉為高壓迫，若患者能夠耐受。溫和壓迫對不能耐受高壓迫的患者也有益。在專業干預前，以及在等待ABPI測量結果期間，溫和壓迫是一種有價值的首選策略。", "applications": ["情境一：阿嬤腳常常腫脹、有傷口，但去大醫院檢查要等很久。現在家庭醫生可以先用彈性繃帶做溫和加壓，減輕阿嬤的不舒服，也避免傷口惡化，同時安排後續的詳細檢查。", "情境二：王先生有糖尿病，腳的血液循環比較差，以前醫生不敢隨便加壓治療他的腳。現在有了這個研究，醫生可以先用比較輕的壓力，幫助王先生的傷口癒合，同時密切觀察他的狀況，再決定要不要增加壓力。", "情境三：李小姐因為工作久站，小腿靜脈曲張很嚴重，腳踝附近出現潰瘍。因為預約血管外科醫生需要時間，社區藥局的藥師可以建議她先使用溫和的彈性襪，舒緩不適，並建議她盡快尋求專業醫療協助。"], "audio": "audios/40504400.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-12T21:17:04.138165"}

The relationship between these normal-range PFT parameters and long-term outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. Objective-Evaluate the clinical utility of PFT parameters among DEPS and examine associations with baseline respiratory symptoms, functional limitations, healthcare utilization, and longitudinal trajectories. Methods-We identified veterans in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry who enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration and had at least one PFT after the end of their initial deployment (1990-2019) and before completion of the Registry self-assessment questionnaire (2014-2024). We defined DEPS as having no airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second-to-forced vital capacity ratio≥lower-limit-of-normal or LLN) or restriction (total lung capacity≥LLN). We applied adjusted mixed-effects regression and machine learning to assess the predictive value of PFT parameters for key outcomes. We also examined the longitudinal trajectories of DEPS's PFT patterns using interval-censored Cox proportional hazards regression. Results-Among eligible veterans with complete data (n=3,814), 68% reported respiratory symptoms (modified Medical Research Council or mMRC≥1) but most had preserved spirometry (DEPS, 49%), followed by obstructive (28%), restrictive (21%), and mixed (2%) PFT patterns. Among DEPS (n=1,879, 37±10 years-old, 86% male, 15% current and 19% former smoker, 64% mMRC≥1), several PFT parameters were linked to outcomes, but diffusing capacity (DLCO) was the strongest predictor, showing significant relationships with many outcomes (Odds ratios ranging from 0.46 to 0.89, all P<0.05). Among the 289 DEPS with follow-up PFT 6±4 years later, those with baseline isolated reduction in DLCO (<LLN) were more likely to develop restrictive impairments compared to those with normal DLCO (33% vs. 19%, P=0.048).

Most of the existing deep learning-based methods can achieve wonderful results, but it is difficult to generalize well to other HSIs with different data distributions.

To address above issues, we propose a hybrid Transformer-based contrastive domain adaptation (CDAFormer) framework for unsupervised hyperspectral change detection, which can effectively use prior information to improve the detection performance in the absence of labeled training samples by separately aligning the changed and unchanged deference features of two domains. Concretely, the difference features of the two domains are fed into the hybrid Transformer block for preliminary coarse contrastive domain alignment. Then, the positive and negative feature pairs generated from the hybrid Transformer block are prepared for the loss function level fine alignment. Particularly, the domain discrepancy can be bridged by pulling the category-consistent difference feature representation closer and pushing the category-inconsistent difference feature representation far away, so as to maintain the separability between domain invariant difference features. The acquired domain invariant distinguishing features are subsequently fed into the fully connected layers to derive the detection results.

Multimorbidity patterns among individuals with OUD are not well established, and minimal research exists examining the impact of clustering methods on identifying these patterns.\nOBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess multimorbidity prevalence, explore associated sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and determine multimorbidity patterns using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and K-means clustering among people receiving treatment for OUD in Ontario, Canada between 2011 and 2021.\nMETHODS: Data from two prospective cohort studies were merged and linked to Ontario provincial health administrative databases. We identified 16 chronic conditions, used in prior research examining multimorbidity in Ontario, using ICD-10-CA diagnostic codes and the diagnostic codes of physician billing claims using a 2-year lookback. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of 2+ of the above conditions, excluding the diagnosis of OUD. We conducted a retrospective cohort study, following the participants for eight years in the data holdings to ascertain the prevalence of multimorbidity. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed using modified Poisson regression models, and multimorbidity patterns were identified through HCA and K-means clustering.\nRESULTS: Among 3,430 people with OUD, 32.5% (n = 1,114, 95% confidence interval (CI)=30.9, 34.1) experienced multimorbidity over an eight-year period, with older age (Prevalence Ratio (PR)=3.39, 95% CI = 2.36, 4.87) and unemployment (PR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.54) associated with increased prevalence. HCA identified six distinct disease clusters, whereas K-means clustering identified four clusters. Both methods identified groupings of cardiovascular (coronary syndrome), cardiometabolic (diabetes, hypertension), and respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diseases, reflecting shared comorbidities among people with OUD.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the substantial burden of multimorbidity among populations with OUD, and the importance of considering sociodemographic factors in understanding multimorbidity prevalence. Moreover, the choice of clustering method significantly influences the identification and interpretation of multimorbidity patterns, with HCA providing more clinically meaningful groupings compared to K-means clustering.

However, existing methods often focus on task-specific knowledge, overlooking the importance of shared, task-agnostic knowledge. Inspired by the complementary learning systems theory, which posits that humans learn continually through the interaction of two systems - the hippocampus, responsible for forming distinct representations of specific experiences, and the neocortex, which extracts more general and transferable representations from past experiences - we introduce Information-Theoretic Complementary Prompts (InfoComp), a novel approach for CTC. InfoComp explicitly learns two distinct prompt spaces: P(rivate)-Prompt and S(hared)-Prompt. These respectively encode task-specific and task-invariant knowledge, enabling models to sequentially learn classification tasks without relying on data replay.

Even large language models, which show excellent performance on various tasks, have progressed slowly in clinical practice tasks. Providing precise and explainable treatment plans with personalized details remains a big challenge for AI systems due to both the highly specialized medical knowledge required and patients' complicated conditions.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an explainable and efficient decision support system named H-SYSTEM to assist neurosurgeons in diagnosing and treating patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The system was designed to address the limitations of existing AI systems by integrating a medical domain knowledge graph to enhance decision-making accuracy and explainability.\nMETHODS: The H-SYSTEM consists of 3 main modules: the key named entity recognition (NER) module, the semantic analysis and representation module, and the reasoning module. Furthermore, we constructed a medical domain knowledge graph for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, named HKG, which served as an external knowledge brain of the H-SYSTEM to enhance its text recognition and automated decision-making capability. The HKG was exploited to guide the training of the semantic analysis and representation module and reasoning module, which makes the output of the H-SYSTEM more explainable., To assess the performance of the H-SYSTEM, we compared it with doctors and different large language models.\nRESULTS: The outputs based on HKG showed reliable performance as compared with neurosurgical doctors, with an overall accuracy of 94.87%. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, inflated dilated convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and conditional random fields (BERT-IDCNN-BiLSTM-CRF) model was used as the key NER module of the H-SYSTEM due to its fast convergence and efficient extraction of key named entities, achieved the highest performance among 7 key NER models (precision=92.03, recall=90.22, and F1-score=91.11), significantly outperforming the others. The H-SYSTEM achieved an overall accuracy of 91.74% in treatment plans, showing significant consistency with the gold standard (P<.05), with diagnostic measures achieving 88.18% accuracy, 97.03% area under the curve (AUC), and a κ of 0.874; surgical therapy achieving 98.53% accuracy, 98.53% AUC, and a κ of 0.971; and rescue therapies achieving 89.50% accuracy, 94.67% AUC, and a κ of 0.923 (all P<.05). Furthermore, the H-SYSTEM showed high reliability and efficiency when compared to doctors and ChatGPT, achieving statistically higher accuracy (95.26% vs 91.48%, P<.05). Additionally, the H-SYSTEM achieved a total accuracy of 92.22% (ranging from 91.14% to 95.35%) in treatment plans for 605 additional patients from 6 different medical centers.\nCONCLUSIONS: The H-SYSTEM showed significantly high efficiency and generalization capacity in processing electronic medical records, and it provided explainable and elaborate treatment plans.

Furthermore, in multimodal 3D object detection, the lack of depth information in images can lead to distortions in the image BEV features generated through view transformations, further leading to inaccuracies in the fused BEV representation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BEVFix, an innovative end-to-end 3D object detection method designed to refine BEV representations. BEVFix starts by generating a mask based on the point cloud distribution to identify specific regions requiring repair.

This perspective evaluates those recommendations using established screening principles and the published literature. The recommendation to screen for heart failure using natriuretic peptide lacks robust evidence in several key areas. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, or NT-proBNP, itself performs poorly as a screening test in asymptomatic adults. Furthermore, there is ambiguity in treatment recommendations and insufficient evidence showing improved outcomes with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor treatment in adults with diabetes and stage B heart failure. Finally, the costs involved are high and may not be economically justifiable. Similarly, the recommendation to screen for PAD in asymptomatic adults with diabetes is not backed by rigorous scientific evidence. The evidence cited combines ABI screening with other effective screening tests and has limited generalizability. There is no guidance on how to interpret the results of ABI testing or how the information gained should be used to direct treatment.

However, it is still unclear whether this is a generalized or domain-specific phenomenon. Employing a well-validated fMRI paradigm, we investigated pain empathic reactivity across two domains: observation of physical pain (noxious stimulation) and affective pain (facial expressions). On the basis of a generalized hyperexcitability/hyperreactivity in migraine, we hypothesized abnormal responses to both dimensions of pain empathy.\nMETHODS: We collected fMRI and psychometric data from 21 migraine patients and matched controls. Univariate and multivariate neuroimaging analyses were utilized to examine domain-specific dysregulations in (a) neural reactivity in meta-analytically defined shared regions of pain-empathy processing, and (b) whole-brain neurofunctional signatures of physical and affective pain empathy (VPS, Zhou et al., 2020). Logistic regression models and machine learning-based classification were employed to determine differences between groups (migraine or control).\nRESULTS: Migraine patients exhibit increased neural responses during empathy for physical pain in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (slightly more pronounced on the right side), with alterations on the right significantly associated with the pain experienced during the attack. On the whole-brain level, the predictive accuracy of the VPS for physical pain empathy was shown to be significantly higher for patients as compared to controls, reaching 100% accuracy. Across analyses, we did not find evidence of altered empathy processing for affective pain.\nCONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, our results indicate that migraine patients present a domain-specific increased brain responsivity, localized in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus but also extending to subtle whole brain patterns, during empathy for physical pain stimuli, but not during empathy for affective pain. Based on the evidence that the neural pathways for empathy for physical pain and experimental pain robustly overlap, these results indicate a specific hyperresponsivity of the pain pathways, with the inferior frontal gyrus likely playing a regulatory role in modulating pain-related processes.

In this study, enabled by deep learning-based cell segmentation and recognition, we developed a computational pipeline to systematically quantify the spatial distribution features of tumour cells, stromal cells, and lymphocytes in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathological images of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified six cellular spatial features that consistently and significantly correlated with the overall survival of patients in two independent HCC patient cohorts, The Cancer Genome Atlas Program cohort and the Beijing Hospital cohort. Each threshold for patient stratification was the same for both cohorts, and the six features independently served as prognostic indicators when individually analysed alongside clinical variables. Furthermore, the combination of features such as the mean value of cellular diversity around stromal cells (StrDiv-M), the median distance between all cells (CellDis-MED), and the median value of variation coefficient of the distance around stromal cells and their neighbours (CvStrDis-MED) could further stratify the patient prognosis. In addition, incorporating cell spatial features with another clinical feature, microvascular invasion improved prognostic stratification efficacy for patients from both cohorts.

This review highlights data from recent publications on lymphoma patient survival.

This review critically assesses current methods for measuring and predicting fouling during thermal processing in the dairy industry, emphasizing scientific principles, technical maturity, and industrial applicability. Unlike existing reviews, which are mostly focused on fouling quantification, this work highlights the shift toward prediction-driven approaches for fouling control and minimization. Traditional measurement techniques, such as monitoring thermal resistance and pressure drop, are evaluated alongside emerging methods, including acoustic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical sensors. Their respective limitations and strengths are discussed in terms of sensitivity, scalability, and industrial robustness. Advanced predictive tools, including deep learning, computational fluid dynamics, and dimensional analysis techniques, are explored for their ability to model the dynamic nature of fouling and support real-time decision-making. The integration of artificial intelligence with real-time process data acquisition is identified as a key innovation for improving fouling management and optimizing cleaning schedules. The review also considers the importance of small-scale experimental systems in linking laboratory-scale research with industrial applications. Development and utilization of tools for enhanced process efficiency through prediction, prevention, and control of in-process fouling are growing. Greater control in this regard offers substantial opportunity to meet future challenges in process optimization, shorten cleaning-in-place times, and advance sustainable dairy manufacturing through real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and industrial-scale implementation.

A promising novel therapeutic class emerges with T-cell engaging therapies, which include CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy and CD3xCD20 directed bispecific antibodies (BsABs). This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of their efficacy and safety along with logistical considerations in relapsed/refractory (r/r) iNHL.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Several pivotal CAR-T trials have presented impressive response rates and durable remissions in r/r FL, while data in MZL is scarce. CAR-T is given as a single infusion, but requires a complex logistical infrastructure. Different BsAbs have shown favorable efficacy with a lower rate of acute toxicities. Off-the-shelve availability favors its usability, although prolonged administration of BsAbs might impose a substantial burden for patients. Long-term infection risk is a concern for both treatments.

Herbal compounds, which have often been considered as complex and poorly understood entities, have historically been investigated using linear screening approaches and reductionist bioactivity models. A novel paradigm being presented in this work is herbal holography. Herbal molecules are seen by it as multi-dimensional systems best understood using holographic and quantum theories. As the pharmacological potential of plant-based compounds is under expanding research, more intricate integrated approaches are needed to grasp their bioactivities, predict their pharmacokinetics, and maximize drug lead optimization. The aim is to ascertain whether using quantum-driven methods results in a real revolution in herbal medicine or if it is really a pipe dream.\nMETHODS: This paper conducts a thorough examination of herbal remedies, focusing on how algorithms powered by hybrid quantum-classical simulations, deep learning models, and quantum mechanics can address the shortcomings of traditional methods. The advanced computational approaches explored in this research provide scalable models for modeling herbal compounds and assessing their pharmacological effects. Integrating views from systems biology, photochemistry, and quantum mechanics helps one to evaluate the translational usefulness of these technologies.

Here, the immunomodulatory effects of IL-33/ST2 axis during perinatal Lm infection were investigated. In our study, the perinatal Lm infection model was constructed by injecting Lm into the tail vein of C57BL/6J mice. IL-33/ST2 axis was blocked by intraperitoneal injection of anti-IL-33Rα/ST2 antibody. In vitro, mouse cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line (CTLL)-2 cells were activated by using CD3/CD28 antibodies. Perinatal Lm infection caused massive necrosis of liver tissue. Blocking IL-33/ST2 axis in pregnant mice inhibited the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into the site of infection and further aggravated liver damage. We also found that IL-33 promotes mitochondrial autophagy in activated CTLL-2 cells in vitro. Mitochondrial autophagy was beneficial to the clearance of damaged mitochondria and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species.

Radiomics provides informative multidimensional features that can help identify high-risk populations and can improve the diagnostic performance of CCTA. However, its role in predicting MACEs remains highly debated.\nOBJECTIVE: We evaluated the diagnostic value of ML models constructed using radiomic features extracted from CCTA in predicting MACEs, and compared the performance of different learning algorithms and models, thereby providing clinical recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of MACEs.\nMETHODS: We comprehensively searched 5 online databases, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Elsevier, CNKI, and PubMed, up to September 10, 2024, for original studies that used ML models among patients who underwent CCTA to predict MACEs and reported clinical outcomes and endpoints related to it. Risk of bias in the ML models was assessed by the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, while the radiomics quality score (RQS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the radiomics prediction model development and validation. We also followed the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) guidelines to ensure transparency of ML models included. Meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc software (version 1.4), which included the I² score and Cochran Q test, along with StataMP 17 (StataCorp) to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. Due to the high heterogeneity observed, subgroup analysis was conducted based on different model groups.\nRESULTS: Ten studies were included in the analysis, 5 (50%) of which differentiated between training and testing groups, where the training set collected 17 kinds of models and the testing set gathered 26 models. The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for ML models predicting MACEs was 0.7879 in the training set and 0.7981 in the testing set. Logistic regression (LR), the most commonly used algorithm, achieved an AUROC of 0.8229 in the testing group and 0.7983 in the training group.

Despite the potential of wearable devices for continuous hydration monitoring, health research hasn't fully explored this application, and clear design guidelines are absent. This scoping review aimed to address this gap by analyzing current research trends and assessing the potential impact of wearable technologies for hydration monitoring.\nOBJECTIVE: This review comprehensively examined recent advancements in wearable hydration-monitoring technologies, focusing on their capabilities, limitations, and research and prototype designs. It explored various sensors and technologies used to track hydration, compared their advantages and disadvantages, identified trends in wearable hydration-monitoring devices, evaluated their accuracy and reliability against established benchmarks, and reviewed commercially available products to bridge research findings and practical applications.\nMETHODS: Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar for studies (2014-2024) on noninvasive wearable devices that used physiological biomarkers. Validation with human participants or comparisons with gold standards was required. Data extraction covered study characteristics, sensor technologies, validation methods, and commercial product analysis. In addition to academic research papers, gray literature was included through a Google Scholar search to investigate commercial products in the field of hydration monitoring. This approach ensured a broader perspective on technological advancements and market trends.\nRESULTS: The review synthesized 63 articles selected from 156 included for full-text analysis. The literature was categorized based on sensor types, including electrical, optical, thermal, microwave, and multimodal sensors. Most studies (47/63, 75%) examined the effects of hydration on physiological parameters, with some (16/63, 25%) focusing on hydration status during physical activity or in specific environmental conditions. Commercially available products from 8 companies were also evaluated for their technological features, functionalities, and applications. The dominance of electrical sensors in research was highlighted due to their ease of use and integration into wearable devices.

It further sought to compare differences in mental health indicators and SNA levels across various risk groups and adherence patterns, and to identify the optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for students at high risk of SNA.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited a total of 12,541 university students from the university town of Guizhou Province as participants. Data were collected through standardized questionnaires, including the Chinese version of Social Network Addiction Scale for College Students (SNAS-C), the adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) self-report scale (ASRS), and the Chinese version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Self-Report Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for Adults (DSM-5 CCSM), among others. The primary analytical method used was the random forest model, which was used to explore the relationship between different 24-HMG behavior combinations and mental health variables among student at high-risk of SNA. In addition, the study aimed to identify the optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for this high-risk group.\nRESULTS: Participants in the meeting none group exhibited the highest SNA scores (57.98), which declined progressively with greater adherence. Among single-guideline groups, meeting physical activity (PA; 53.07) and meeting sedentary time (ST; 52.72) showed similar scores. Further reductions were seen in meeting PA+ST (49.68), meeting sleep (48.44), and meeting ST+sleep (44.75), with the lowest in meeting PA+ST+sleep. Approximately 6% of the variance in SNA was attributable to differences in adherence patterns (η²=0.06). Students meeting all three 24-HMG components-PA, sleep, and ST-demonstrated the strongest protection against attention deficit, depression, and anxiety. All 24-HMG behaviors were inversely associated with mental health symptoms, except academic satisfaction, which was positively correlated. Random forest modeling identified meeting sleep+ST as the most impactful for mania (0.4491), sleep disturbance (0.4032), personality (0.3924), and dissociation (0.3832). Meeting ST alone showed the strongest effects on substance (0.6176) and alcohol use (0.6597).

However, excessive doses cause erythrocytosis (raised red cell mass), especially if other risk factors are present.

Testosterone is now increasingly prescribed to older men with functional hypogonadism and obesity, hypertension or type 2 diabetes; who are anyway at higher risk of both erythrocytosis and thrombosis. Although short-medium term testosterone treatment in these men was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, there were more cases of pulmonary embolism. Originally envisaged as purely oral hypoglycaemic drugs, Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are now increasingly prescribed in chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular impairment, irrespective of glycaemia, and the likelihood of co-prescription with testosterone is thus increased considerably. Crucially, they also increase haematocrit by promoting haematopoiesis. This review focuses on the current best evidence for managing erythrocytosis, in the context of more prevalent obesity and prescriptions of testosterone and SGLT2i in this population.

With growing recognition of their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and organ-protective properties, GLP-1RAs show promise in managing complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and multiorgan dysfunction. This review explores their mechanisms across vital systems - including cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, and gut-lung-microbiome axes - highlighting preclinical and clinical data. By consolidating emerging findings, this review aims to inform future translational research and support the integration of GLP-1RAs into critical care strategies.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence highlights GLP-1RAs as promising adjuncts in critical illness due to their multiorgan protective effects. In cardiovascular systems, GLP-1RAs improve endothelial function, reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, and modulate autonomic tone. In the CNS, they provide neuroprotection by reducing neuroinflammation and pyroptosis. In the lungs, they attenuate ARDS by decreasing cytokine production, enhancing surfactant secretion, and restoring alveolar-capillary integrity. Renally, they reduce acute injury and preserve filtration function. In the gut, GLP-1RAs modulate the microbiome, enhance barrier integrity, and lower systemic inflammation via the gut-lung axis. Additionally, they reduce hepatic inflammation and support pancreatic beta-cell survival, improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic stability in critical care.\nSUMMARY: GLP-1 receptor agonists hold promise as multiorgan protective agents in critical illness, offering benefits beyond glucose control. Their anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and vaso-protective properties may be harnessed to prevent or attenuate organ failure, support recovery, and improve long-term outcomes in critically ill patients.

There is a high prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus in the U.S. military, and therefore, it is important to assess the impact of tinnitus on functional performance. The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of tinnitus on a range of subjective, objective, auditory, and cognitive measures. A secondary aim was to determine which factors best predict whether individuals ever self-reported tinnitus. A prospective study was conducted to address the primary aim, and an exploratory machine learning approach was used to address the second.\nMETHOD: The study included 463 active duty U.S. Service members being seen for annual hearing surveillance.

Pseudotime analysis of human T cells and treatment of Hepa1-6 orthotopic liver tumor mouse models with CCR7+CD8+ T-cell transfusions were used to show that CCR7+CD8+ T cells can differentiate into cytotoxic effector T cells. The same models demonstrated that combination therapy activated VEGFC and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, promoting HEV formation. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high HEV density correlated with improved clinical response and prolonged survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: HEVs are pivotal in modulating immune activity within the HCC tumor microenvironment.

Diabetes prevalence and complications, notably diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), continue to rise, challenging health care despite advancements in medicine. Traditional DFU detection methods face scalability issues due to inefficiencies in time and practical application, leading to high recurrence and amputation rates alongside substantial health care costs. Human medical thermography could significantly enhance disease monitoring and detection, including DFUs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of artificial intelligence-powered thermography in detecting plantar thermal patterns that differentiate between adult patients with diabetes with no visible foot ulcers and healthy individuals without diabetes.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included 200 patients-100 healthy and 100 with diabetes without a visible foot ulcer. Initial data were gathered through a questionnaire. Participants were prepared for thermal imaging to capture plantar thermal patterns. All collected data, including thermal images and questionnaire responses, were stored on a password-protected computer to ensure confidentiality and data integrity.\nRESULTS: In this study, participants were categorized into 2 groups: a healthy control group (n=98) with no prior diabetes or peripheral artery disease diagnosis and normal circulatory findings, and a group with diabetes (n=98) comprising patients with diabetes, regardless of peripheral circulatory status. Temperature analysis indicated a wider range in the group with diabetes (18.1-35.6 °C) than in the healthy controls (21.1-35.7 °C), with the former showing significantly higher mean temperatures (mean 29.0 °C, SD 3.0 °C) than controls (mean 28.9 °C, SD 2.8 °C; P<.001). Analysis of both feet revealed significantly greater differences between feet in the group with diabetes and the controls (control: mean 0.47 °C, SD 0.43 °C; group with diabetes: mean 1.78 °C, SD 1.58 °C; P<.001; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). These results identified clinically relevant abnormalities in 10% of the cohort with diabetes, whereas no such findings were observed in the control group. We used a linear regression model to indicate that being diagnosed with diabetes is a significant predictor of abnormal temperature, while age and sex were not found to be significant predictors in this model.\nCONCLUSIONS: DFUs pose a significant health risk for patients with diabetes, making early detection crucial. This study highlights the potential of an artificial intelligence-powered computer vision system in identifying early signs of diabetic foot complications by differentiating thermal patterns between patients with diabetes with no visible ulcers and healthy individuals. The findings suggest that the technology could improve early diagnosis and outcomes in diabetic foot care, although further research is needed to fully validate its effectiveness.

In many molecules, fluorine is incorporated to enhance the half-life and improve bioavailability.

The human gut microbiota is known for its xenobiotic biotransformation capabilities, but it was not previously known whether gut microbial enzymes could break carbon-fluorine bonds, potentially altering the toxicity of these compounds. Here, through the development of a rapid, miniaturized fluoride detection assay for whole-cell screening, we identified active gut microbial defluorinases. We biochemically characterized enzymes from diverse human gut microbial classes including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, with the capacity to hydrolyze (di)fluorinated organic acids and a fluorinated amino acid. Whole-protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design enabled the identification of a disordered C-terminal protein segment involved in defluorination activity. Domain swapping exclusively of the C-terminus conferred defluorination activity to a nondefluorinating dehalogenase. To advance our understanding of the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and nondefluorinating dehalogenases, we trained machine learning models which identified protein termini as important features. Models trained on 41-amino acid segments from protein C termini alone predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy (compared to 95% accuracy based on full-length protein features).

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view (FoV) and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle areas or high-echogenic tissue regions within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate the motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we employ a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics.

Although XRT has been shown to improve time to tumor progression, there has never been a controlled study in this population in which adjuvant XRT (aXRT) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) over initial observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing of XRT on survival in IDHm-glioma.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study, comprising a cohort of adult patients with grade 2 or 3 IDHm-gliomas seen at 2 academic centers (University of Washington and Stanford University) between 2007 and 2022 (identified through research data registries). The main comparison of interest was patients who received XRT within 3 months of diagnosis and before progression, that is, as adjuvant treatment (aXRT), versus those who did not have aXRT (deferred XRT, dXRT). The primary outcome measures were median progression-free survival and OS. Survival analysis was performed through multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling, propensity matching, and subset analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 450 eligible patients were identified (mean age 39.7 years; 41% female). The median survival of the combined cohort was 19.1 years (25th-75th percentiles 9.75-27.8 years). 47.1% of patients received aXRT. Patients with aXRT demonstrated similar time to next intervention (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.65-1.07) but showed a markedly diminished OS compared with the dXRT cohort (HR of death 2.90, 95% CI 1.9-4.42, p < 0.001). This shorter OS with aXRT was appreciated in all assessed subgroups, including patients considered high risk by grade, age, and extent of resection. This shorter OS was also consistent in multivariable analysis and in propensity-matched cohorts.\nDISCUSSION: Although retrospective, the marked OS difference between aXRT and dXRT groups suggests that aXRT may be not be as beneficial as what was once thought, especially regarding long-term survival.

Notably, the HA-evernic acid conjugate demonstrated the strongest binding to BCL-2 (-10.1 kcal/mol), forming two hydrogen bonds (Ala97, Glu133) and four hydrophobic interactions (Asp100, Arg143, Val145, Tyr199). Similarly, the HA-salazinic acid conjugate displayed high affinity for histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6; -9.9 kcal/mol). The top-performing compounds, fumarprotocetraric acid, salazinic acid, topotecan, and their HA conjugates, were advanced to computational validation. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that HA-salazinic acid (HA-SAL) possessed optimal ADMET properties, including 71.39% human intestinal absorption, no inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes or P-glycoprotein, and low toxicity in cardiac (hERG), hepatic, and aquatic models. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations highlighted the HA conjugates of fumarprotocetraric acid (HA-FUM) and salazinic acid as superior to topotecan, with HA-FUM showing the lowest energy gap (-0.1038 eV) and highest softness (19.2678 eV), indicative of enhanced reactivity. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated the stability of HA-salazinic acid-HDAC6 (PDB ID 3PHD) and HA-evernic acid-BCL-2 (PDB ID 4MAN) complexes, outperforming the standard drug hyaluronic acid conjugate. These results underscore the potential of lichen compound-HA conjugates, particularly fumarprotocetraric acid, salazinic acid, and evernic acid, as candidates for cervical cancer therapy.

Then, 120 unseen liver mpMRI examinations of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis or healthy controls were assessed by coregistering the labels to noncontrast and contrast-enhanced T1 and T2 relaxation time maps for optimization and internal testing. The algorithm was externally tested in a segmental and total liver analysis of previously unseen 65 patients with biopsy-proven liver fibrosis and 25 healthy volunteers. Measured relaxation times were compared to manual measurements using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Wilcoxon test.\nRESULTS: Comparison of manual and deep learning-generated segmental areas on different T1 and T2 maps was excellent for segmental (ICC = 0.95 ± 0.1; p < 0.001) and total liver assessment (0.97 ± 0.02, p < 0.001).

We performed a literature review of A.I applications in orthopaedics and contextualized these studies based on their alignment with allocative value, technical value, and personal value. We synthesized our findings using descriptive analysis and the Gartner Hype Cycle.\nRECENT FINDINGS: 82% of research activity involving A.I and its applications in musculoskeletal care is dominantly focused on technical value, which can be divided into three main sub-groups: imaging and diagnostics, prognostic outcomes and risk factors, and A.I integration within medical devices and care pathways. A.I advancing personal value (18% of studies) is rapidly gaining traction. Relatively few studies (< 1%) focused on allocative value. Emerging applications of A.I in orthopaedics providing 'technical value' include machine learning algorithms for predicting risk and prognosis, diagnostic computer vision algorithms, models advancing surgical robotics; 'personal value' include ambient listening technology, A.I scribes, triage of clinical messages, patient engagement via LLM chatbots, pre-charting applications; and emotional intelligence.

However, data collection and interpretation are often challenging, and traditional methods such as exponential fitting and phasor plot analysis require a high number of photons per pixel for reliably measuring the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore. To satisfy this requirement, prolonged data acquisition times are needed, which makes FLIM a low-throughput technique with limited capability for in vivo applications. Here, we introduce FLIMngo, a deep learning model capable of quantifying FLIM data obtained from photon-starved environments. FLIMngo outperforms other deep learning approaches and phasor plot analyses, yielding accurate fluorescence lifetime predictions from decay curves obtained with fewer than 50 photons per pixel by leveraging both time and spatial information present in raw FLIM data. Thus, FLIMngo reduces FLIM data acquisition times to a few seconds, thereby, lowering phototoxicity related to prolonged light exposure and turning FLIM into a higher throughput tool suitable for the analysis of live specimens. Following the characterization and benchmarking of FLIMngo on simulated data, we highlight its capabilities through applications in live, dynamic samples. Examples include the quantification of disease-related protein aggregates in non-anaesthetised Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans, which significantly improves the applicability of FLIM by opening avenues to continuously assessCaenorhabditis elegansthroughout their lifespan.

This decline is a consequence of structural, molecular, and metabolic changes occurring in aging kidneys. Understanding the mechanisms that accelerate kidney aging may help manage CKD and promote healthy aging. Recently, it has been shown that protein translation errors accelerate aging in mammals. Mice heterozygous for the ribosomal ambiguity mutation Rps9D95N, which results in genome-wide error-prone translation, have reduced life span, increased macroscopic signs of aging, and exhibit a neuropathological phenotype resembling early signs of Alzheimer disease. Here, using deep phenotyping, we investigated the kidneys of Rps9D95N/+ mice and showed that genome-wide error-prone translation is also associated with signs of premature kidney aging. These mice have renal amyloidosis, an altered glomerular basement membrane, reduced autophagy in kidney tissue, and renal fibrosis compared to age-matched aged mice. These alterations in kidney tissue were accompanied by signs of kidney dysfunction such as albuminuria and elevated levels of Kim-1, a marker of kidney injury and kidney disease progression. In addition, lipid metabolism is altered, as shown by RNAseq and targeted metabolomic analysis, suggesting increased lipid deposition as lipid droplets in the Rps9D95N knock-in mice.

Consequently, DNA methylation remains a key biomarker in cancer research, playing a vital role in diagnosis, prognosis, and tailored treatment strategies. Aberrant methylation patterns enable early cancer detection and therapeutic stratification; however, their complex patterns necessitates advanced analytical tools. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning networks and graph-based models, have revolutionized cancer epigenomics by enabling rapid, high-resolution analysis of DNA methylation profiles. Moreover, these technologies are accelerating the development of Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) tests, such as GRAIL's Galleri and CancerSEEK, which improve diagnostic accuracy across diverse cancer types. In this review, we explore the synergy between AI and DNA methylation profiling to advance precision oncology. We first examine the role of DNA methylation as a biomarker in cancer, followed by an overview of DNA profiling technologies. We then assess how AI-driven approaches transform clinical practice by enabling early detection and accurate classification. Despite their promise, challenges remain, including limited sensitivity for early-stage cancers, the black-box nature of many AI algorithms, and the need for validation across diverse populations to ensure equitable implementation.

While ChatGPT has generated significant debate regarding its utility and ethics, its growing popularity suggests that patients may increasingly use such tools for medical information. The study specifically examines how patients who have undergone radiation therapy for meningioma perceive the information generated by ChatGPT, integrating both patient feedback and clinical assessment.\nMETHODS: Eight meningioma-related questions on diagnosis, treatment options, and radiation therapy were posed to ChatGPT 4. A questionnaire with these responses and feedback items was developed to assess utility, accuracy, clarity, and alignment with patients' experiences. Nine clinicians first rated each response's relevance, correctness, and completeness on a five-point Likert scale. Subsequently, 28 patients with meningioma completed the questionnaire during their first follow-up visit (three months post-radiation therapy). Finally, the same questions were presented to three other large language models (ChatGPT 4o mini, Gemini Free, Gemini Advanced), and seven blinded clinicians rated each model's responses before selecting the most accurate, eloquent, and comprehensive overall.\nRESULTS: The study cohort included 28 meningioma patients, mostly female, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients found the information clear, accurate, and reflective of their experiences, with 60% willing to use ChatGPT for future inquiries. Clinicians rated the relevance and correctness of the information highly, although completeness was rated slightly lower, particularly for questions about specific radiation therapy details and side effects. ChatGPT 4 and its newer version ChatGPT 4o mini received the highest, nearly identical scores among the four LLMs evaluated, while Gemini Free scored the lowest in clinician assessments.\nCONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT demonstrates potential as a supplementary educational tool for meningioma patients, though some areas may require improvement, particularly in providing comprehensive information.

It summarizes clinical trial data alongside mechanistic insights to provide a comprehensive assessment of therapeutic outcomes beyond diabetes mellitus.\nFINDINGS: Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with or without diabetes. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors provide kidney protection by enhancing tubuloglomerular feedback, improving renal blood flow, and reducing inflammation and ischemic tissue damage. They also provide cardiovascular benefits to dialysis patients while maintaining effective blood flow during dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) outside clinical trials.

However, the role of visceral adiposity, due to its adverse metabolic profile, should also be addressed in PWT1D. We aimed to assess the 10-year CV risk of PWT1D according to body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), a parameter for estimating visceral adiposity.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional study, PWT1D in primary CV prevention from the SFDT1 cohort were categorized by BMI status, either normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) or overweight/obesity (≥ 25 kg/m2), and by WHtR according to the validated threshold of 0.5.

In particular, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been used in the clinic for more than twenty years for applications in bone healing. It has been demonstrated to be an effective tool to treat different chronic diseases. We sought to evaluate the effects produced by LIPUS on the properties of human breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs).\nMETHODS: Cells were stimulated using a traditional ultrasound device with the following parameters: 0.05 W/cm2 with 10% duty cycle, frequency of 3 MHz and 8 pulses.\nRESULTS: At the parameters used, the ultrasound did not directly affect bCSC proliferation, with no evident changes in morphology. In contrast, the ultrasound protocol affected the migration and invasion ability of bCSCs, limiting their capacity to advance while a major affection was detected on their angiogenic properties. LIPUS-treated bCSCs were unable to transform into aggressive metastatic cancer cells, by decreasing their migration and invasion capacity as well as vessel formation. Finally, RNA-seq analysis revealed major changes in gene expression, with 676 differentially expressed genes after LIPUS stimulation, 578 upregulated and 98 downregulated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results highlight the potential of LIPUS as a promising non-invasive therapy to target bCSCs and attenuate its capacity to drive migration, invasion, angiogenesis and, ultimately, tumor malignancy. Besides, the ability of LIPUS to modulate gene expression points out its capacity to broadly influence the cellular transcriptome.

Molecular regulation of UB branching is rather well studied, whereas the cellular mechanisms and tissue organization during UB arborization are less understood. Here, we characterized epithelial cell morphology in three dimensions (3D), studied mechanisms regulating cell shape changes, and analyzed their contribution to novel branch initiation in normal and branching-incompetent bud tips. Unbiased machine-learning-based segmentation of tip epithelia identified geometrical round-to-elliptical transformation as a key cellular mechanism facilitating growth direction changes to gain optimal branching complexity. Cell shape and molecular analyses in branching-incompetent epithelia demonstrated a distinct failure to condense cell size and modify its conformation. This, together with changes in adhesive forces, defective actin dynamics, and disorganization in myosin-9 (MYH9)-based microtubules, suggests altered biophysical properties in tip cells, where branch point decisions are made and actualized. The data demonstrate that dynamic changes in volume and morphology of individual epithelial cells, together with optimal traction stress, facilitate novel branch formation in the UB tip niche.

This umbrella review aimed to evaluate the impact of different exercise interventions on patients with DPN.\nMETHODS: The search was conducted in the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, from the establishment of the database up to the search date (September 11, 2023). We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing exercise interventions in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and DPN. Studies were selected based on predefined PICO criteria. The methodological quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Results were synthesized narratively and categorized by exercise type and health outcome.\nRESULTS: Fourteen reviews were included, examining the effects of various exercise interventions. Duration ranged from one week to 12 months, and studies were conducted in multiple countries. Additionally, we extracted and reanalyzed individual results from 70 primary studies included within the reviews. Some meta-analyses reported significant improvements in fasting glucose and HbA1c (n = 1), neuropathic symptoms (n = 3), physical function (n = 1), static and dynamic balance (n = 2), range of motion (n = 1), and fear of falling (n = 1). No significant effects were found for BMI, ulcer incidence, adverse events, weight-bearing activity, quality of life, or forefoot plantar pressure (n = 1). Outcome assessment tools included the Biodex system (n = 9), single-leg stance (n = 8), Berg Balance Scale (n = 11), and Timed Up and Go (n = 13) for balance; nerve conduction velocity (n = 8), MNSI (n = 6), and Total Symptom Score (n = 3) for nerve function; fasting glucose (n = 3) and HbA1c (n = 5) for glycemic control. Other outcomes included muscle strength (n = 6), functional capacity (n = 6), pain (n = 6), and quality of life (n = 6).\nCONCLUSIONS: Exercise training appears to have potential benefits for certain aspects of DPN, neuropathic symptoms, and functional capacity. However, the effects on glycemic control, fall risk reduction, and ulcer prevention remain inconclusive, with significant variability in study outcomes.", "authors": ["Gracia-Sánchez Alba", "López-Pineda Adriana", "Nouni-García Rauf", "Zúnica-García Sara", "Chicharro-Luna Esther", "Gil-Guillén Vicente F"], "published_date": "2025-06-15", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "運動訓練對糖尿病周邊神經病變患者的影響：一項統合文獻回顧", "summary_zh": "糖尿病周邊神經病變是糖尿病常見且嚴重的併發症，影響感覺、運動和自主神經，增加足部潰瘍和跌倒的風險。此統合文獻回顧評估了不同運動介入對糖尿病周邊神經病變患者的影響。研究結果顯示，運動訓練在改善神經病變症狀和功能方面具有潛在益處，例如降低空腹血糖和糖化血色素、改善神經病變症狀、增強身體機能、靜態和動態平衡、關節活動度，並減少對跌倒的恐懼。然而，對於血糖控制、降低跌倒風險和預防潰瘍的效果仍不明確，研究結果存在顯著差異。因此，運動對於糖尿病周邊神經病變的益處仍需更多研究證實。", "applications": ["阿公有糖尿病，腳常常麻麻的，走路也比較不穩。這個研究說，做一些運動，像是散步或踩腳踏車，可能可以改善他的腳麻和平衡感，讓他走路更穩，比較不會跌倒。", "我媽媽是糖尿病患者，她很擔心會得到神經病變，聽說會讓腳很痛很不舒服。這個研究告訴我們，運動可以幫助控制血糖，甚至可以減少神經病變的症狀，讓她可以更健康快樂的生活。", "醫院可以根據這個研究結果，設計一套適合糖尿病周邊神經病變患者的運動計畫。透過運動，幫助患者改善症狀，提升生活品質，也減少他們因為神經病變而產生的其他問題，像是跌倒或足部潰瘍。"], "audio": "audios/40517337.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-15T21:15:49.120706"}

However, manual charting is tedious, time consuming, and prone to errors. Attempts to automate charting using AI have focused on computer vision of radiographs, which does not replace visual inspection and has limitations in community screening settings. We aim to develop a deep-learning-based real-time charting using intra-oral videos. This study encompasses tooth identification, the initial phase of our development process.\nMETHODS: 100 intra-oral videos were recorded, annotated using CVAT software, and split into training and testing datasets (80:20 ratio) to develop an object detection YOLOv7x model on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was evaluated by its ability to accurately detect each tooth's ID (class) and position using the mean average precision (AP), which encases a confusion matrix, Precision and Recall, based on a minimum overlap of 50% between manual and automated annotation (Intersection over Union IoU = 0.5).\nRESULTS: Of the 186,332 captured image frames; 8747 were annotated, with data augmentation yielding 17,494 images.

This preclinical evaluation comprised an in vitro screen of potential novel synergistic drug combinations with [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1, and an in vivo efficacy analysis of the lead drug combination in PSMA-expressing prostate cancer xenografts.\nMETHODS: In total, 177 anticancer drugs were screened in a clonogenic survival assay of 22Rv1 cells which used 5-fold serial dilutions of the test drug (≤ 20 μM) to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), compared to incubations of the test drug plus [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 (15 MBq) after 10 days. A subsequent focused screen assessed the impact of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 (0-25 MBq/mL) on drug IC50. Synergy scores were determined using the zero interaction potency (ZIP) reference model (ZIP scores >5 % indicate high synergistic potency) and the multidimensional synergy of combinations (MuSyC) platform (log α >0 indicates synergistic potency). Therapeutic efficacy of the lead drug combination was evaluated in vivo: intravenous [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 (30 MBq, single dose) and oral cobimetinib (0.25 mg/day for 21 days) (alone/in combination) were administered to 22Rv1 tumor-bearing NMRI nude mice (eight mice/group plus untreated controls).

We sought to determine if a scanning protocol that replaced conventional workflows with advanced technologies such as multiplane imaging, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation could be used to optimise conventional workflows and potentially reduce ergonomic risk for cardiac sonographers. The aim was to assess whether this alternate protocol could reduce active scanning time as well as interaction with the ultrasound machine compared to a standard echocardiogram without a reduction in image quality and interpretability.\nMETHOD AND RESULTS: Volunteer participants were recruited for a study that comprised of two TTE's with separate protocols. Both were clinically complete, but Protocol A combined automation, AI assisted acquisition and measurement, simultaneous and multiplane imaging whilst Protocol B reflected a standard scanning protocol without these additional technologies.

For example, the frequent mutation, Y537S, was shown to trigger a constitutively active receptor leading to reduced affinity for both agonist and antagonist ligands. The development of more comprehensive therapies remains a challenge in BC patients exhibiting activating mutations in ERα. Here, we show that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) may be considered as a novel therapeutic target in ERα-positive BC.\nMETHODS: ERα wild type or Y537S mutated MCF7 and T47D BC cell lines were used as model systems. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, gene silencing, real-time PCR, promoter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) as well as cell viability, colony and cell cycle assays served to investigate the involvement of PARP-1 in BC progression. The growth of MCF7 ERα Y537S cells injected into the mammary ducts of NSG mice and treated with the ERα antagonist lasofoxifene or the PARP-1 inhibitor niraparib was monitored by luminescence imaging, weight measurement, and histological analysis. RNA sequencing studies were performed on the above-described xenograft tumors. METABRIC dataset was used to evaluate the clinical significance of PARP-1 and the biological role of the PARP-1-associated genes in ERα-positive BC patients.\nRESULTS: We first demonstrated that the up-regulation of PARP-1 expression induced by estrogens is abrogated either by inhibiting or silencing ERα in MCF7 and T47D BC cells expressing ERα wild type or Y537S mutation. We then showed that PARP-1 is involved in the binding of ERα and its co-activator FoxA1 to the promoters of several target genes, as determined by ChIP-sequencing studies. Of note, the inhibition of PARP-1 prevented the proliferative effects mediated by ERα in BC cells expressing either wild type or Y537S ERα. In accordance with these findings, the growth of xenograft tumors derived from MCF7 ERα Y537S BC cells was significantly reduced using niraparib and lasofoxifene.

However, research including quantitative morphological information on infected cells is lacking, potentially masking heterogeneity in the infection cycle. In this study, we propose a machine learning (ML) pipeline to incorporate morphological profiling into the analysis of spatially resolved single-molecule mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)-imaging flow cytometry (IFC) data acquired on infected G. huxleyi populations.

Meat is a tasty source of high-quality protein and micronutrients, whose integration with alternative proteins offers new avenues to address technical and consumer-driven challenges. Meat-based hybrids, also called dual-protein foods, combine meat with alternative proteins like plant proteins, edible insects, microalgae, and nutritional yeast, offering a promising solution by improving resource efficiency while retaining familiar taste and nutritional benefits of meat. However, challenges remain regarding protein compatibility, functionality, and consumer acceptance. This review critically examines recent advances in hybridizing meat with alternative proteins, highlighting the pivotal roles of pH, temperature, and salt concentration in modulating protein-protein interactions and functionalities essential for cohesive hybrid systems. Emerging protein combinations, such as plant-yeast or microalgae-yeast blends, offer promising but underexplored opportunities in hybrid systems to enhance nutritional value and functional performance. Additionally, this review synthesizes recent consumer studies, highlighting that taste, texture, visual appeal, perceived nutritional and environmental benefits are primary drivers of acceptance and willingness to pay for hybrid products.

A machine learning framework, which encompassed a series of combined binary classifiers tailored to various NTAA conditions was developed. Within this framework, disease information was recursively inferred across three tiers: primary categories (I-level), disease subtypes (II-level), and specific diseases (III-level). In model training, the REFCV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation) approach was employed for feature refinement, and five algorithms-Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting-were assessed.

We systematically investigate the diverse levels of regulation that impact MGMT expression in glioma. These include epigenetic regulation, transcriptional control, post-translational modifications, and the influence exerted by the tumor microenvironment. Epigenetically, methylation of CpG islands within the MGMT promoter region represents a critical determinant for gene silencing. Conversely, histone modifications such as H3K4me3 augment MGMT expression. Transcriptionally, a complex network of transcription factors, which encompasses Sp1, p53, and NF-κB, along with signaling pathways like TGF-β, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT, orchestrates MGMT expression in glioma cells. Furthermore, post-translational modifications of MGMT, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are of pivotal importance in modulating its stability and enzymatic activity. The tumor microenvironment, with factors such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, and immune responses, also exerts a significant influence on MGMT expression.

In current clinical practices, considerable challenges are encountered in the early identification of suicide risk, as traditional assessment tools demonstrate limited predictive accuracy. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present promising solutions for risk prediction. However, comprehensive evaluations of their efficacy in adolescent populations remain insufficient.\nOBJECTIVE: This study systematically assessed the performance of ML-based prediction models across various suicide-related behaviors in adolescents, aiming to establish an evidence-based foundation for the development of clinically applicable risk assessment tools.\nMETHODS: This review assessed ML for predicting adolescent suicide-related behaviors. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were rigorously searched until April 20, 2024, and a multivariate prediction model was employed to assess the risk of bias. The c-index was used as the primary outcome measure to conduct a meta-analysis on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide attempts combined with suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts combined with NSSI, evaluating their accuracy in the validation set.\nRESULTS: A total of 42 studies published from 2018 to 2024 were included, encompassing 104 distinct ML models and 1,408,375 adolescents aged 11 to 20 years.

As health care technology evolves, there is a need to design \"future-proofed\" physical environments that integrate technology in ways that support workflows and maintain clinical performance. Assessing how current technologies affect nursing workflows can help inform the development of these future environments.\nOBJECTIVE: We assessed the current challenges nursing staff face in inpatient rooms, gather insights on technology, and build environment interactions to envision the design of a technology-integrated \"Inpatient Room of the Future.\"\nMETHODS: A qualitative study was conducted involving semistructured interviews, shadowing, and focus groups among nursing staff in the inpatient setting. Methods including horizon scanning, scenario analysis, technology assessment, and backcasting facilitated a comprehensive qualitative analysis of current technology use and needs in inpatient nursing workflows to inform exploratory design considerations for technology-integrated envisioned futures solutions.\nRESULTS: In total, 26 nursing staff across 4 inpatient hospital units participated in this study. Analysis identified four major themes considered central to designing a technology-integrated inpatient room that enhances nursing workflow and experience: (1) the need for seamless integration of technologies advocating for a unified system that minimizes fragmented technology use and enhances efficiency; (2) the potential for technology to reduce cognitive load, alleviate mental strain, and streamline complex workflows; (3) a focus on enhancing interpersonal communication with specific emphasis on tools that facilitate clear and efficient communication among clinicians and with patients; and (4) the importance of improved staff well-being with design considerations aimed at promoting both physical and mental health for health care workers in the inpatient setting. Envisioned future solutions included enhanced patient monitoring with automated measurements and actions through computer vision and data triangulation, a smart electronic health record-integrated supply management system using computer vision to detect supply shortages and auto-delivery of needed supplies, and a personal tech smart assistant capable of real-time patient monitoring and escalation, task prioritization, and hands-free clinical documentation and communication.\nCONCLUSIONS: While current technologies address specific tasks, there are significant opportunities for better technology integration, reducing cognitive load, enhancing communication, and promoting the physical and mental well-being of nursing staff. Future research should focus on seamless technology integration aligned with clinical workflows and implementing supportive technologies that do not interfere with clinician judgment and critical thinking.

Understanding variability in tendon protein composition may help improve our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of painful tendon degeneration and inform treatment targets.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What factors (tendon region, individual characteristics, presence of disease) contribute to protein compositional (proteomic) and structural variation in human Achilles tendons? (2) What compositional changes characterize tendinopathy, and what protein interactions might contribute to tendon degeneration? (3) How does diabetes influence tendon composition, and what mechanisms might underlie tendon dysfunction in individuals with diabetes?\nMETHODS: In this exploratory, cross-sectional study, human Achilles tendon specimens were obtained from individuals with (diabetes group, n = 5) or without diabetes (control group, n = 5) undergoing lower extremity amputation and from individuals undergoing tendon debridement surgeries for tendinopathy (tendinopathy group, n = 8). Specimens were collected between 2019 and 2023. Protein abundances were quantified and analyzed using mass spectrometry, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis. To evaluate the role of tendon region and donor on tendon protein compositional variability, we assessed proteomic differences between three regions in nontendinopathic tendons from three individuals. To identify the contribution of disease (that is, presence of tendinopathy or diabetes) on protein composition, we compared tendons from the tendinopathy (n = 8 [2 males, 6 females], mean ± SD age 48 ± 11 years), diabetes (n = 5 [3 males, 2 females], age 54 ± 9 years), and control (n = 5 [3 males, 2 females], age 42 ± 12 years) groups. Proteomic differences associated with tendinopathy and diabetes were further examined using functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analysis.\nRESULTS: Variability in tendon protein composition was primarily from presence of disease, followed by donor and then tendon region. Protein composition distinguished tendons with tendinopathy from controls, with 311 proteins differentially expressed (152 overexpressed and 159 underexpressed; fold change ≥ 1.5, p < 0.05) and higher Bonar scores indicating greater degeneration (mean ± SD Bonar score tendinopathy group 8.6 ± 1.2 versus control group 2.1 ± 0.7; p = 0.01). Pathway analysis identified dysregulation in extracellular matrix remodeling (TIMP1, MMP3, MMP10), inflammatory response (TNF-α, EGFR1), and metabolic reprogramming. Tendons from individuals with diabetes exhibited minimal proteomic changes compared with the control group, with 66 differentially expressed proteins (31 overexpressed and 35 underexpressed; fold change ≥ 1.5, p < 0.05) with no histopathologic differences between diabetes and control group tendons (mean ± SD Bonar score diabetes group 3.4 ± 1.0 versus control group 2.1 ± 0.7; p = 0.19). Tendons in the diabetes group showed reductions in Type I collagen, enrichment of pathways associated with fibrosis and metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory pathways associated with α6β4 integrin.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Achilles tendon composition primarily differs based on disease etiology, with tendinopathy showing extensive extracellular matrix disruption and inflammatory activity, whereas tendons from individuals with diabetes exhibit more subtle compositional changes. This distinction suggests that tendinopathy may require targeted interventions addressing tissue remodeling and inflammation, whereas diabetes may predispose tendons to injury but not directly result in degeneration. Understanding these protein compositional variations can help refine hypotheses about disease progression, treatment response, and potential therapeutic targets.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: While proteomic analysis is not currently a part of routine clinical assessment, these findings provide a framework for identifying protein markers that may aid in early diagnosis or patient stratification to improve treatment alignment. Future studies could determine whether these proteomic changes correlate with treatment response and further inform our understanding of early-stage degeneration from chronic disease.

To gain a deeper insight onto the metastatic mechanism of HYP, integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics were conducted following the treatment of MCF-7 cells with HYP. HYP significantly activates PI3K/AKT pathway, a hallmark of cancer metastasis. Glycerolipid and fatty acid metabolisms are among the top-upregulated lipid metabolic pathways, while glycolysis is dysregulated. Seahorse real-time ATP rate analysis revealed a significant decrease in ATP production from the glycolysis pathway in HYP-treated cancer cells.

We included adult females diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in Ontario (2007-2018). IDD status was identified using an established algorithm. We estimated associations between IDD and surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation using cause-specific hazards models in four distinct cohorts determined by stage and treatment eligibility. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR; adjusted for region, rurality, previous cancer, stage and year of diagnosis) with 95 % confidence intervals are reported, accounting for the competing event of death. Cancer subtype was not adjusted for as about 25 % of participants were missing this information. Effect modification by age, stage and comorbidity was explored.\nRESULTS: The four cohorts included 100,679 (IDD = 369), 12,526 (IDD = 57), 60,279 (IDD = 167), and 7891 individuals (IDD = 22), respectively. Relative to those without IDD, people with IDD were less likely to receive surgical resection (HR = 0.84; 0.76-0.94), breast conserving surgery (HR = 0.69; 0.60-0.80), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.49; 0.32-0.74), and radiation (HR = 0.58; 0.46-0.73). People with IDD were as likely to receive mastectomy (HR = 1.13; 0.97-1.33). Significant interactions by age and IDD were detected for receipt of mastectomy (interaction p-value = 0.03) and breast conserving surgery (interaction p-value = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Research to understand treatment decision-making, the accessibility of breast cancer treatment, and to examine potential pathways to improve receipt of guideline-recommended care are needed to inform targeted improvements in care delivery.", "authors": ["Hansford Rebecca L", "Wilson Brooke", "Griffiths Rebecca", "Mahar Alyson L"], "published_date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "智能或發展障礙與具治癒性的女性乳癌治療：一項基於人口的回溯性世代研究", "summary_zh": "這項研究探討了智能或發展障礙（IDD）的女性乳癌患者，在治療上的差異。研究發現，相較於沒有IDD的患者，IDD患者接受手術切除、乳房保留手術、輔助化學治療和放射治療的可能性都較低。但接受乳房切除術的可能性相似。研究結果顯示，IDD患者在乳癌治療方面存在明顯的不足。未來需要更深入的研究，以了解治療決策的過程、治療的可及性，並找出改善照護的途徑，確保所有患者都能獲得適當的治療。這項研究強調了關注弱勢群體，並提供更公平醫療服務的重要性。", "applications": ["1. 醫療決策輔助：透過這項研究，醫療團隊可以更了解智能或發展障礙患者在乳癌治療上可能遇到的困難，在制定治療計畫時，能更周全地考慮到患者的特殊需求，提供更客製化的醫療建議。", "2. 政策制定參考：政府或醫療機構可以參考這項研究的結果，重新檢視現有的醫療政策和資源分配，確保智能或發展障礙患者能夠公平地獲得所需的醫療服務，減少健康上的不平等。", "3. 公眾意識提升：透過宣傳這項研究的發現，可以提高社會大眾對於智能或發展障礙患者在醫療照護上的困境的認識，鼓勵更多人關心這個群體，共同營造一個更友善、更包容的醫療環境。"], "audio": "audios/40523325.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-17T03:47:22.907252"}

Psychological distress, a frequently overlooked factor in routine clinical practice, is a key variable, as it may be both a consequence of and a contributing factor to difficulties with dietary-insulin treatment in this population. It could contribute to the development of disturbed eating behaviors and more severe mental health conditions, such as eating disorders.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the present systematic review was to study the relationship between the presence of psychological distress and disturbed eating behaviors in young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nDATA SOURCES: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases for articles meeting the inclusion criteria as at October 2024.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Ten observational studies analysing the relationship between psychological distress and disordered eating behavior were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the STROBE and the Newcastle-Ottawa checklists.\nDATA ANALYSIS: Initially, 366 articles were identified. Of these, 10 articles were eligible for the review (2420 participants). Psychological distress was found to have a robust association with disturbed eating behaviors in all studies. Most of them found a strong association between these 2 variables and HbA1c and that women had higher levels of psychological distress and more disordered eating behaviors compared with men.\nCONCLUSION: Psychological distress may contribute to the onset and persistence of disordered eating behaviors and eating disorders in this population. This finding underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to type 1 diabetes mellitus clinical management, and the need for addressing both psychological and behavioral factors.

Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial fermentation pathways in CD, but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), highlighting disruptions that explain the depletion of butyrate-a key anti-inflammatory metabolite-observed in metabolomics analysis. Integrative multi-omics analyses further identified active virulence factor genes in CD, predominantly originating from the adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). Notably, these findings unveiled novel mechanisms, including E. coli-mediated aspartate depletion and the utilization of propionate, which drives the expression of the ompA virulence gene, critical for bacterial adherence and invasion of the host's macrophages.

Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how different interoceptive dimensions (e.g., self-report) and organ systems (e.g., cardiac, gastric) relate to each other and to disordered eating behaviors such as emotional, external and restrained eating. We assessed multiple dimensions (behavioral, self-reported, and physiological) in the cardiac domain (interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive self-report, interoceptive insight and objective physiological state) and in the gastric domain (gastric interoceptive sensitivity, gastric attribution of interoceptive sensations, interoceptive self-report, interoceptive insight and objective physiological state). The first goal of this study was to examine the relationship between cardiac and gastric interoception measured via multiple dimensions (behavioral, self-reported, and physiological). The second goal was to investigate whether multidimensional gastric interoception was a more important predictor of emotional, external and restrained eating than multidimensional cardiac interoception.\nMETHODS: Our sample (n = 128) was predominantly female (n = 116), included healthy individuals (n = 87) and individuals with an eating disorder or sub-clinical eating disorder (n = 41). Instruments included a heartbeat counting task, the two-step Water Load Test, electrocardiogram, electrogastrogram and the Dutch-Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. We used correlation analysis, multiple regressions, and LASSO regressions. The final sample included in the multiple regression and LASSO regressions resulted in N = 89.\nRESULTS: Results showed cardiac and gastric interoception to be distinguishable, yet not to be entirely independent processes. Results further suggest gastric and not cardiac interoception to be the most important predictor of emotional, external and restrained eating. Specifically gastric attribution of interoceptive sensations played the most important role in all disordered eating behaviors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of the gastric system in the assessment and targeted treatment of disordered eating behaviors.

To address this issue, this study proposes a Bayesian Mixture Expert Recognition Model for Tobacco Leaf Curing Stages based on feature fusion. First, deep learning models (ResNet34, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetb0) are utilized to extract deep features and traditional features positively correlated with curing stages from a constructed tobacco leaf image dataset. Various feature fusion methods (concatenate fusion, scaled fusion, adaptive gated fusion) are employed to construct multi-level feature representations. Next, different feature fusion methods of the same model are optimized to select the best-performing model as the foundational model for ensemble learning. Finally, Bayesian optimization is applied to integrate three optimized models, and comparisons are made with voting and weighted averaging methods. The proposed model achieves a recognition accuracy of 93.96% on the test set, with other performance metrics surpassing those of the base models.

In addition, 105 external data sets from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2018 were used to verify the constructed model. The end point was entry into end-stage renal disease or a doubling of serum creatinine (Scr) level from baseline. Kaplan-Meier curve survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to find independent prognostic factors. MATLAB 2018b and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to construct prognostic risk factor prediction models each for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Western Medicine, and integrated TCM and Western Medicine. The ANN model incorporated WANG Yongjun's new five-type syndrome differentiation for IgAN. The prediction efficiencies of the three models were compared using the confusion matrix and the area under thecurve (AUC).\nRESULTS: Patients from 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2015 were followed for a mean of (46 ± 19) months. The 5-year median overall renal survival time was 58.6 months, and a total of 40 patients (5.4%) entered the endpoint. Ratio of males to females was 1.48:1. Median age of patients undergoing renal puncture was 35 years. Median 24-hour urinary protein was 0.55 g and 37 patients (5.0%) had pronounced proteinuria (24-hour urine protein ≥ 3.5 g). Median serum creatinine was 76 μmol/L and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was (90 ± 33) mL/min per 1.73 m2. Oxford classification of renal pathology suggested a high rate of focal segmental glomeru-losclerosis (80.3%). Use of immunosuppressants was the most common (71.3%) treatment after renal puncture and improved clinical outcomes of IgAN. TCM differentiation of kidney deficiency was the most common syndrome (69.5%).

This study aimed to investigate whether histogram analysis (HA) of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) imaging using a manually segmented three-dimensional (3D) volume of interest (VOI), excluding cystic or necrotic portions, could demonstrate a higher correlation with the tumor characteristics than an entire tumor VOI, therefore could improve the preoperative evaluation of supratentorial pediatric gliomas.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a current prospective study, 31 pediatric patients with pathologically-confirmed gliomas who underwent baseline DWI were enrolled. The patients were classified by histopathology according to tumoral grade: 15 had pLGGs and 16 had pHGGs. Tumoral VOIs were calculated and transferred to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Histogram analysis (HA) was performed to determine mean, maximum (max), minimum (min), kurtosis, skewness, entropy, standard deviation (SD), mean of positive pixels (MPP), and uniformity of positive pixel (UPP) values for ADC. Comparisons of the values of each ADC parameter within the entire tumoral VOIs (VOI 1) and the tumoral VOIs excluding cystic or necrotic portions (VOI 2) were performed.\nRESULTS: In VOI 1 placement, ADCmin and rADCmin were significantly lower in pHGG compared with pLGG with p = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively. In VOI 2 placement, ADCmean, ADCmedian, ADCmin, ADC MPP, rADCmean, rADCmedian, rADCmin and rADC MPP were significantly lower in pHGG compared with pLGG with p < 0.001. The HA parameters and the ratio of HA parameters of peritumoral edema were not statistically significant difference between LGG and HGG groups with p < 0.05. In VOI 1 placement, the ratio of ADCmin had higher diagnostic ability (AUC = 0.838) compared with ADCmin (AUC = 0.800). In VOI 2 placement, ADCmin had highest diagnostic ability with AUC = 0.904. The optimal cut-off for ADCmin was 587x10-6 mm2/s with Se of 93.3%, Sp of 81.2% and Youden index of 0.746.

Because limb loss can have severe consequences on individual fitness, it is likely subject to significant selective pressures, making this an excellent phenomenon with which to investigate biomechanical robustness. Spiders frequently autotomize one or more legs. We investigated the time course of locomotor recovery after leg loss and regeneration in juvenile tarantulas (Arachnida: Araneae) naive to autotomy. We recorded high-speed video of spiders running with all legs intact, then immediately after, and again 1 day after they had autotomized two legs. The legs were allowed to regenerate, and the same sequence of experiments was repeated. Video tracking analysis revealed that the spiders resumed their pre-autotomy speed and stride frequency after leg regeneration and in ≤1 day after both autotomies; path tortuosity was unaffected by these treatments. Autotomized spiders widened the spread of their remaining legs for stability and to compensate for missing functional space. To analyze how their gaits changed in response to leg loss, we applied unsupervised machine learning for the first time to measured kinematic data in combination with gait space metrics. Spiders were found to robustly adopt new gait patterns immediately after losing legs, with no evidence of learning. This novel clustering approach both demonstrated concordance with hypothesized gaits and revealed transitions between and variations within these patterns.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of preoperative exercise on physical fitness in older patients with low physical fitness scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, patients ≥65 years of age, who were scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery were included if they had a low maximal walking speed. Exercise for 2 to 3 weeks before surgery was home-based, high-intensity, and partly supervised by a primary care physiotherapist. The intervention consisted of inspiratory muscle training, aerobic, and strength exercises. A control group underwent usual preoperative care. Physical fitness was assessed with the 6-min walk test (primary outcome), the 30-s chair stand test and maximal inspiratory pressure which estimates inspiratory muscle strength (secondary outcomes). The effect of preoperative exercise on these outcomes before and after surgery was analyzed with linear mixed-models for the 6-min walk test and maximal inspiratory pressure and with a non-parametric Friedman rank sum test for the 30-s chair stand test. To evaluate adherence, physical activity was measured and compared for both groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 52 participants were included. Analyses showed a statistically significant effect of preoperative exercise on postoperative inspiratory muscle strength. We did not find an effect of preoperative exercise on 6-min walk test or 30-s chair stand test performance. Regarding preoperative physical activity, the intervention group engaged more in high-intensity physical activity in relation to their total stepping time compared to the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise before colorectal cancer surgery can provide benefits in terms of increased postoperative inspiratory muscle strength in older patients with low physical fitness. While we could not demonstrate an effect of preoperative exercise on any other outcomes, these results should be interpreted with caution due to a small sample size.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, identification number: NCT04878185, URL: Study Details | Optimizing Physical Function Before Cancer Surgery in Older People at Risk | ClinicalTrials.gov.", "authors": ["Danielsson Johanna", "Engström Sid Julia", "Andersson Mikael", "Nygren-Bonnier Malin", "Egenvall Monika", "Hagströmer Maria", "Vossen Laura E", "Dohrn Ing-Mari", "Rydwik Elisabeth"], "published_date": "2025-06-17", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "大腸直腸癌手術前優化體能 (CANOPTIPHYS)：術前運動對老年人術前和術後體能的影響 - 一項隨機對照試驗", "summary_zh": "這項研究針對體能較差、準備接受大腸直腸癌手術的年長者，探討術前運動的效果。研究讓部分患者在術前2-3週進行居家高強度運動，包含呼吸肌肉訓練、有氧和肌力訓練，並與接受常規術前照護的對照組比較。結果顯示，術前運動能顯著提升術後的呼吸肌力。雖然在其他體能指標（如6分鐘步行測試和30秒椅子站立測試）上未觀察到明顯效果，但研究團隊認為這可能與樣本數較小有關。總體而言，短期的術前運動有助於改善老年患者術後的呼吸功能。", "applications": ["想像一下，阿公準備要開大腸癌手術，開刀前讓他做一些簡單的運動，像是深呼吸、舉啞鈴、在家裡走來走去，這樣可以幫助阿公開完刀後比較有力氣呼吸，比較快恢復。", "如果醫院可以提供一套術前運動計畫，讓病人可以在家裡練習，就像是開刀前的暖身操一樣，這可以幫助年紀大的病人開完刀後，比較不會因為體力不好而產生併發症。", "很多研究都在告訴我們運動很重要，這個研究更進一步告訴我們，就算是要開刀的人，在開刀前做一些運動，對身體也是有幫助的，所以大家平常沒事就要多動一動，讓身體保持在最好的狀態。"], "audio": "audios/40525350.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-17T18:24:39.126318"}

Pure shift methods convert multiplets into singlets to greatly improve the spectral resolution but lead to severe sensitivity loss, aggravating the issue of low sensitivity of NMR compared to that of other spectroscopic techniques. Pure shift yielded by the chirp excitation (PSYCHE) method is currently the most popular pure shift method. But relatively small flip angles of chirp pulses are used to achieve a balance between the sensitivity and purity, leading to relatively low spectral sensitivity. In this work, the flip angle of 60° is utilized in the PSYCHE experiment to increase the sensitivity by four times but with strong recoupling artifacts. Then, a deep neural network model is employed to remove recoupling artifacts to obtain a clean spectrum. The model can correctly recognize all peaks, remove recoupling artifacts and chunking sidebands, and retain the desired pure shift peaks. The processed spectra are clean and free of recoupling artifacts.

The goal of this study was to assess the current integration of CMC education into advanced education in general dentistry (AEGD) and general practice residency (GPR) curricula.\nMETHODS: A 46-question cross-sectional survey was sent electronically to all 265 U.S. AEGD and GPR program directors (PDs) in February 2019. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions about CMC curricular content, mode of delivery, barriers to teaching the content, evaluation technique, and competence of residents upon graduation. The survey was adapted from relevant literature and prior validated surveys. The data were analyzed using univariate statistics such as frequencies and percentages to describe all survey items.\nRESULTS: Of the 265 programs surveyed, 42% of PDs responded (N = 111). Most agreed that it was important for residents to receive training to identify diabetes (88%), hypertension (90%), and obesity (78%). However, only 62% of PDs taught their residents to identify obesity compared with hypertension (90%) and diabetes (85%). Regarding health assessments, nearly half the PDs reported that their residents do not collect body mass index for obesity, while only 12% and 4% were not collecting HbA1c values and blood pressure, respectively.

In this technology, cells are cultured to form a monolayer, which is then detached from the culture surface as a complete sheet. This process preserves cell interactions, maintains cellular phenotypes and functions, and retains the integrity of the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM). A main characteristic of the cell sheet is its ability to retain the native ECM components secreted by cells. When the ECM is preserved in cell sheets, cells are surrounded by a much more biologically appropriate environment to increase their regenerative potential, thereby offering more native conditions for cell growth and differentiation. CSE has shown promising results in a wide range of applications, including bone and cartilage. The cell sheets can be directly transplanted to the target site, where they integrate with the host tissue and enhance regeneration. The main challenge in CSE is how to detach an intact cell sheet without disturbing the ECM and cell‒cell connections. There are various methods for removing cell sheets that lead to the harvesting of intact cell sheets. Among the various methods for harvesting cell sheets, temperature-responsive systems and mechanical peeling are the most common. Mechanical harvesting, in particular, is a simple, cost-effective, accessible method that is widely used in research, especially in the scope of bone and cartilage tissue engineering.

These inconsistencies, compounded by variations in frozen section (FS) production across laboratories, highlight the need for improved diagnostic tools. This study aims to develop and validate a deep-learning model that transforms cryosectioned images into formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) images to enhance diagnostic performance in breast lesions.\nMETHODS: We developed an unpaired image-to-image translation model (AI-FFPE) using the TCGA-BRCA dataset to convert FS images into FFPE-like images. The model employs a modified generative adversarial network (GAN) enhanced with an attention mechanism to correct artifacts and a self-regularization constraint to preserve clinically significant features. For validation, 132 FS whole slide images (WSIs) of breast lesions were collected from three cohorts (SYSUCC, GSPCH, and TCGA). These FS-WSIs were transformed into AI-FFPE-WSIs and independently evaluated by six pathologists for image quality, diagnostic concordance, and confidence in lesion properties and final diagnoses. Diagnostic performance was assessed using a diagnostic score (DS), calculated by multiplying the accuracy index by the confidence level. The dataset included 132 reference diagnoses and 1,584 pathologist reads.\nRESULTS: The AI-FFPE group showed a significant improvement in image quality compared to the FS group (p < 0.001). Concordance rates for lesion properties (79.9% vs. 79.9%) and final diagnoses (82.7% vs. 82.6%) were similar between two groups. In concordant cases, the AI-FFPE group demonstrated significantly higher diagnostic confidence than the FS group, with more diagnoses definitively categorized based on lesion properties (54.3% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.001) and final diagnoses (48.3% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). Paired t-tests revealed that the diagnostic scores in the AI-FFPE group were significantly higher than in the FS group (overall DS, 13.9 ± 6.6 vs. 12.0 ± 6.6, p < 0.001; DS for lesion property, 6.8 ± 3.8 vs. 5.8 ± 3.7, p < 0.001; DS for final diagnosis, 7.1 ± 3.2 vs. 6.2 ± 3.2, p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that poorer image quality, atypical ductal hyperplasia/ ductal carcinoma in situ cases, and less experienced pathologists were associated with decreased diagnostic accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The AI-FFPE model improved perceived image quality and diagnostic confidence among pathologists in breast lesion evaluations.

Crossover operators play a crucial role in this context. Here, we describe a large class of these operators designed for searching over spaces of graphs. These operators are based on introducing small cuts into graphs and rejoining the resulting induced subgraphs of two parents. This form of cut-and-join crossover can be restricted in a consistent way to preserve local properties such as vertex-degrees (valency), or bond-orders, as well as global properties such as graph-theoretic planarity. In contrast to crossover on strings, cut-and-join crossover on graphs is powerful enough to ergodically explore chemical space even in the absence of mutation operators. Extensive benchmarking shows that the offspring of molecular graphs are again plausible molecules with high probability, while at the same time crossover drastically increases the diversity compared to initial molecule libraries. Moreover, desirable properties such as favorable indices of synthesizability are preserved with sufficient frequency that candidate offsprings can be filtered efficiently for such properties. As an application we utilized the cut-and-join crossover in REvoLd, a GA-based system for computer-aided drug design.

Deep learning promises marker-less tracking based solely on RGB videos to address these challenges. In this paper, object pose estimation is applied to surgical instrument tracking using a novel deep learning architecture.\nMETHODS: We combine pose estimation from multiple views with recurrent neural networks to better exploit temporal coherence for improved tracking. We also investigate the performance under conditions where the instrument is obscured. We enhance an existing pose (distribution) estimation pipeline by a spatio-temporal feature extractor that allows for feature incorporation along an entire sequence of frames.\nRESULTS: On a synthetic dataset we achieve a mean tip error below 1.0 mm and an angle error below 0.2   ∘  using a four-camera setup. On a real dataset with four cameras we achieve an error below 3.0 mm.

However, a significant proportion of patients relapse after CAR-T, and optimal treatment strategies for post-CAR-T relapse remain unclear. Radiotherapy (RT), a highly effective treatment for lymphoma, is increasingly recognized for its potential role as both a bridging therapy and a salvage option following CAR-T relapse.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, with search terms combining \"radiotherapy,\" \"radiation therapy,\" \"lymphoma,\" and \"CAR T-cell.\" A total of 690 records were screened, and 14 studies were included in the analysis after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsRT demonstrates high response rates in CAR-T relapsed DLBCL, with overall response rates (ORR) ranging from 35% to 82.4% and complete response rates (CRR) from 17% to 59%.

These plant-specific genes encode proteins that identify particular molecular patterns associated with pathogens invading the plants. When these resistance genes are active, they initiate a sequence of molecular processes that culminate in the activation of defensive responses such as the synthesis of antimicrobial chemicals, cell wall strengthening, and triggering of programmed cell death in infected cells. Plant resistance genes are exceedingly varied, with several classes and subclasses found across a wide range of plant species. The identification of new resistance genes (Rgenes) is a critical component of disease resistance breeding. Nonetheless, identifying Rgenes in wild species and near relatives of plants is not only challenging but also time-consuming. In this study, we present PRGminer, a deep learning-based high-throughput Rgenes prediction tool. PRGminer is implemented in two phases: Phase I predicts the input protein sequences as Rgenes or non-Rgenes; and Phase II classify the Rgenes predicted in Phase I into eight different classes. Among all the sequence representations tested, the dipeptide composition gave the best prediction performance (accuracy of 98.75% in a k-fold training/testing procedure, and 95.72% on an independent testing) with a high Matthews correlation coefficient (0.98 training and 0.91 in independent testing) in Phase I; phase II (overall accuracy of 97.55% in a k-fold training/testing and 97.21% in an independent testing) with the MCC values of 0.93 for k-fold training procedure and 0.92 in an independent testing.

High-efficiency natural gas (NG) engines, which retain the efficiency of a diesel engine but reduce the carbon content of the fuel, offer substantial potential for near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. A fast-running model that can predict engine performance, GHG and air pollutant emissions is critical to assessing this approach for different applications and vehicle drivetrain configurations. This paper presents the development, validation and application of an engine system model that adapts GT-SUITE™'s phenomenological DI-Pulse predictive model to predict the performance and emissions of a 6-cylinder NG engine using a high pressure direct-injection combustion process. The model includes the engine air exchange system, enabling the prediction of the engine and in-cylinder conditions and overall performance over transient drive cycles. The engine model with a fixed set of calibration parameters captures the complex high-pressure direct injection combustion process and generates time-resolved parameters that are fed into a coupled machine learning model to predict emissions, including nitrogen oxide (NOx) and methane (CH4) emissions. While the 1-D model's predictions for CH4 were not accurate, coupling the 1-D engine model with a machine learning model has been shown to substantially improve the estimation of CH4 emissions and allow accurate prediction of engine total GHG emissions over different duty cycles. The model has been validated using transient engine dynamometer data and is then applied to assess performance and emissions over several regulatory and real-world long-haul drive cycles. The model showed an average error of less than 5% in steady operation. Cumulative errors of NOx and CH4 emissions in studied cycles were also less than 10%. The results showed that CH4 share in total GHG emissions ranges from 0.2% to 1.4% over various drive cycles.

It is characterized by multiple pathological processes, including amyloid-beta accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. The therapeutic efficacy of traditional single-target drugs has been limited, failing to cure, halt, or reverse disease progression. Therefore, this complex disease warrants comprehensive therapeutic strategies like multi-target drug design (MTDD). MTDD represents a promising strategy to target multiple pathological pathways concurrently. The integration of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and nanomedicine, can further enhance the precision and effectiveness of MTDD. This review explores various MTDD approaches, including multi-target-directed ligands, multi-target compound combinations, and polypharmacology. These strategies aim to address the multifaceted nature of AD pathology more effectively than single-target approaches. MTDD offers key advantages, including pathway-level synergy, broader therapeutic scope, and potential for improved efficacy. However, MTDD faces various challenges and limitations, such as the complexity of drug design, difficulty of crossing the blood-brain barrier, and regulatory hurdles. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in computational methods and drug delivery systems show promise in overcoming these barriers. Future research should focus on optimizing delivery systems, improving in silico modeling, and translating multi-target strategies into clinically viable therapies for AD.

ChatGPT-4o generated a primary and 5 differential diagnoses, while 4 LLMs were assessed in both English and Chinese contexts. The lowest-performing model underwent RAG and CoT re-evaluation. Diagnostic accuracy was compared via the McNemar test. A survey evaluated 11 clinicians' familiarity with rare diseases.\nRESULTS: ChatGPT-4o demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy with 90.1%. Language effects varied across models: qwen2.5:7b showed comparable performance in Chinese (51.2%) and English (47.9%; χ²1=0.32, P=.57), whereas Llama3.1:8b exhibited significantly higher English accuracy (67.8% vs 31.4%; χ²1=40.20, P<.001).

Compounding these challenges is a critical shortage of urologists, with 62% of US counties lacking a practicing urologist and only 1 new urologist entering the field for every 10 retiring. This shortage results in delayed diagnoses, increased rates of advanced-stage conditions, and significant health disparities.

This study investigated the influence of cognitive impairment risk factors on cognition and examined how BAG mediates this relationship, particularly in individuals with varying CeVD burden.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed Singaporean community and memory clinic participants. Cognitive impairment risk factors were assessed using the Cognitive Impairment Scoring System (CISS), encompassing 11 sociodemographic and vascular factors. Cognition was assessed through a neuropsychological battery, evaluating global cognition and 6 cognitive domains: executive function, attention, memory, language, visuomotor speed, and visuoconstruction. Brain age was derived from structural MRI features using ensemble machine learning model. Propensity score matching balanced risk profiles between model training and the remaining sample. Structural equation modeling examined the mediation effect of BAG on CISS-cognition relationship, stratified by CeVD burden (high: CeVD+, low: CeVD-).\nRESULTS: The study included 1,437 individuals without dementia, with 646 in the matched sample (mean age 66.4 ± 6.0 years, 47% female, 60% with no cognitive impairment). Higher CISS was consistently associated with poorer cognitive performance across all domains, with the strongest negative associations in visuomotor speed (β = -2.70, p < 0.001) and visuoconstruction (β = -3.02, p < 0.001). Among the CeVD+ group, BAG significantly mediated the relationship between CISS and global cognition (proportion mediated: 19.95%, p = 0.01), with the strongest mediation effects in executive function (34.1%, p = 0.03) and language (26.6%, p = 0.008). BAG also mediated the relationship between CISS and memory (21.1%) and visuoconstruction (14.4%) in the CeVD+ group, but these effects diminished after statistical adjustments.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that BAG is a key intermediary linking cognitive impairment risk factors to cognitive function, particularly in individuals with high CeVD burden.

While diabetes is thought to reduce neuroma risk due to impaired nerve regeneration, the role of metformin on this process remains unclear. This study aims to explore the association of diabetes severity and metformin therapy on painful neuroma formation following lower extremity amputations.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study used TriNetX Research Network to identify adult patients (≥18 years) who underwent lower extremity amputation between January 2016 to February 2024. Patient cohorts were identified using International Classification of Disease-10 and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were stratified by diabetic status, hemoglobin A1c levels, and metformin use. Propensity score matching was performed and adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and medications. Risk differences, risk ratios, and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the association between the exposure and the outcome. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nRESULTS: A total of 16,090 patients underwent lower extremity amputation, 9994 (62.1%) were diabetic, while 6096 (37.9%) were nondiabetic. The overall incidence of symptomatic neuromas was lower in diabetic patients (0.61%) compared to the nondiabetic group (1.67%). After propensity score matching, 5196 diabetic and 5104 nondiabetic amputees were identified. Diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in neuroma risk [risk difference of -0.893% (95% CI: -1.29% to -0.496%); P < 0.0001]. Patients using metformin at the time of surgery had a higher incidence of painful neuroma (0.718%) compared to nonusers (0.424%) (P = 0.127, odds ratio = 1.69).

We eliminated patients with persistent hematological disorders, those on anticoagulant medications, and individuals with uterine deformities. Demographic information, body mass index, initial laboratory results, duration of hospitalization, fetal APGAR scores, and transfers to maternal and neonatal critical care units were all documented from the data system. Patients were categorized into categories based on the stages of placental abruption as outlined in the 2022 emergency obstetric care guide. Stage 0: Asymptomatic patient. Stage I: There is vaginal bleeding, clinical pain in abdomen, no signs of maternal shock or fetal distress. Stage II: There may be vaginal bleeding, no maternal shock. Fetal distress is present. Stage III: There may be maternal shock, intrauterine fetal demise is present. Presence of coagulopathy (30%). The patients were categorized as follows: Group 1 stage 0-I; Group 2 stage II; and Group 3 stage III, and the gathered data were compared among the groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were involved, with 50 patients in group 1. Group 2 comprised 59 patients, whereas Group 3 had 41 patients. Abruptions were most prevalent in group 3.

While the benefits of RT in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are well established, most studies supporting these benefits have been conducted in controlled laboratory or gym settings. To date, it remains unclear whether home-based RT can be as effective as gym-based RT in improving the glycemic profile of patients with T2DM. Therefore, the primary aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of home-based versus gym-based RT on glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM.\nMETHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using SPORTDiscus, PubMed and BISp SURF databases (updated until 2 August 2024). After screening, 20 controlled trials (involving 1397 participants) met the inclusion criteria.\nRESULTS: A random-effects model revealed a significant effect of RT on glycemic control, with a pooled mean difference favoring RT versus control (mean difference: -0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.49 to -0.18). Gym-based RT significantly reduced HbA1c compared to control conditions (-0.39; 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.22), while home-based RT showed no significant effect (+0.12; 95% CI: -0.16 to +0.39).

With advancements in technology, particularly in deep learning and machine learning, researchers and clinicians are leveraging these tools to create complex models that, using MRI data, can reliably detect and classify tumors in the brain. However, it has a number of drawbacks, including the intricacy of tumor types and grades, intensity variations in MRI data and tumors varying in severity. This paper proposes a Multi-Grade Hierarchical Classification Network Model (MGHCN) for the hierarchical classification of tumor grades in MRI images. The model's distinctive feature lies in its ability to categorize tumors into multiple grades, thereby capturing the hierarchical nature of tumor severity. To address variations in intensity levels across different MRI samples, an Improved Adaptive Intensity Normalization (IAIN) pre-processing step is employed. This step standardizes intensity values, effectively mitigating the impact of intensity variations and ensuring more consistent analyses. The model renders utilization of the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform with Enhanced Trigonometric Features (DTCWT-ETF) for efficient feature extraction. DTCWT-ETF captures both spatial and frequency characteristics, allowing the model to distinguish between different tumor types more effectively. In the classification stage, the framework introduces the Adaptive Hierarchical Optimized Horse Herd BiLSTM Fusion Network (AHOHH-BiLSTM).

Advanced imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, have been crucial in detecting calcified nodules, which are more prevalent in patients undergoing hemodialysis and those with pre-existing calcified lesions.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old British man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure presented with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis, leading to a diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction based on elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Imaging revealed significant coronary artery disease, including a patent left anterior descending stent with focal stenosis due to a calcified nodule, chronic total occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery occlusion. The patient was treated with intravenous lithotripsy and balloon angioplasty, along with medical therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. The discussion highlights the challenges of managing calcified coronary lesions, comparing rotational atherectomy, intravenous lithotripsy, and conventional stenting techniques.

Choice of sample materials depends on the research questions and availability: plants or fauna with small ranges are favoured, with some analytes (snails, soil leachates) posing challenges. Interpreting 87Sr/86Sr in biological tissues requires considering Sr metabolism and the timing of tissue formation, thus far underappreciated. The numerous sources of error involved in developing and applying isoscapes must be recognized to avoid over-interpreting data and spurious provenance precision. We hope this paper will help researchers investigating provenance, mobility, landscape use and migration to develop the most appropriate isoscapes for their purposes, and possible future use by others.", "authors": ["Spies Maximilian J", "Alblas Amanda", "Ambrose Stanley H", "Barakat Sarah", "Barberena Ramiro", "Bataille Clément", "Bowen Gabriel J", "Britton Kate", "Cawthra Hayley", "Diamond Roger", "Dosseto Anthony", "Evans Jane A", "Fisher Erich", "Gray Kerryn", "Heddell-Stevens Phoebe", "Holt Emily", "James Hannah F", "Janzen Anneke", "Le Corré Mael", "le Roux Petrus", "Lee-Thorp Julia", "Mackay Alexander", "McNeill Patricia J", "Montgomery Janet", "Mugabe Bedone", "Oelze Vicky M", "Pfab Michèle", "Richards Michael P", "Samec Celeste T", "Santana-Sagredo Francisca", "Serna Alejandro", "Stantis Chris", "Snoeck Christophe", "Stewart Brian", "Stuurman Cameron", "Tarrant Damon", "West Adam G", "Winter-Schuh Christine", "Sealy Judith"], "published_date": "2025-06-19", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "鍶同位素地景圖於溯源、移動與遷徙研究之應用：未來展望", "summary_zh": "鍶同位素(87Sr/86Sr)日益廣泛地被應用於各領域的溯源研究。將其應用於生物材料，需先了解生物可利用的87Sr/86Sr在整個環境中的變異，也就是建立所謂的「同位素地景圖」。本文總結並建議如何理解和建立生物可利用的87Sr/86Sr同位素地景圖。建立方法包括區域劃分、地統計等值線圖和機器學習。選擇適當解析度的地景圖至關重要。樣本材料的選擇取決於研究問題和可利用性。植物或小範圍活動的動物是首選，某些分析物（如蝸牛、土壤淋濾液）則會帶來挑戰。解釋生物組織中的87Sr/86Sr需要考慮鍶代謝和組織形成的時機。我們希望本文能幫助研究人員開發最適合其研究目的的同位素地景圖，並供未來使用。", "applications": ["想像一下，警察叔叔可以用這個技術追蹤罪犯的來源地，就像電影裡演的那樣，分析罪犯身上或物品上的鍶同位素，比對不同地區的同位素地圖，就能大致知道他是從哪裡來的，幫助破案！", "這個技術也能幫助食品安全把關。我們可以分析食品產地的土壤和農作物中的鍶同位素，建立一個資料庫。如果發現市面上販售的食品，它的同位素比例和標示的產地不符，就可能是有問題的黑心商品！", "考古學家也能用這個方法研究古代人類或動物的遷徙路線。分析他們骨骼中的鍶同位素，比對古代的同位素地圖，就能推斷他們生前都去過哪些地方，了解古代文明的發展和交流。"], "audio": "audios/40535935.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-19T15:18:11.582465"}

While traditional methods remain important, they are constrained by the complexity of plant structures, variability in environmental conditions, and the need for high-throughput analysis. Recent advances in imaging technologies and machine learning offer new possibilities, but current methods still face challenges such as noise, occlusion, and limited interpretability.\nMETHODS: In response to these challenges, we propose a novel computational framework that combines deep learning-based text generation with domain-specific knowledge for plant phenotyping. Our approach incorporates three key elements. A hybrid generative model is used to capture complex spatial and temporal phenotypic patterns. A biologically-constrained optimization strategy is employed to improve both prediction accuracy and interpretability. An environment-aware module is included to address environmental variability.\nRESULTS: The generative model uses advanced deep learning techniques to process high-dimensional imaging data, effectively capturing complex plant traits while overcoming issues like occlusion and variability. The biologically-constrained optimization strategy incorporates prior biological knowledge into the computational process, ensuring predictions are biologically realistic and enhancing trait correlations and structural consistency. The environment-aware module adapts dynamically to environmental factors, ensuring reliable predictions across a variety of agricultural settings.\nDISCUSSION: Experimental results show that the framework delivers scalable, interpretable, and accurate phenotyping solutions, setting a new standard for precision agriculture applications.", "authors": ["Zhu Li", "Tang Long", "Ren Shan"], "published_date": "2025-06-19", "journal": "期刊需擴展 EFetch 解析", "doi": "DOI 需擴展 EFetch 解析", "source": "PubMed", "title_zh": "基於深度學習的文本生成技術於植物表型分析和精準農業之應用", "summary_zh": "本研究提出一個結合深度學習文本生成與領域知識的植物表型分析新框架。傳統植物表型分析受限於植物結構複雜、環境多變及高通量需求。本研究利用混合生成模型捕捉植物表型在時空上的複雜模式，並結合生物約束最佳化策略，提升預測準確性與可解釋性。此外，加入環境感知模組以應對環境變異。實驗結果顯示，此框架能提供具備可擴展性、可解釋性與準確性的表型分析解決方案，為精準農業應用樹立新標竿。這項技術可有效處理高維度影像數據，克服遮蔽和變異等問題，並確保預測結果符合生物學邏輯，提升性狀關聯性和結構一致性，在不同農業環境下提供可靠預測。", "applications": ["想像一下，農民伯伯以後可以透過手機App，拍張農作物的照片，App就能自動分析出作物的健康狀況、生長階段，甚至預測未來的收成，幫助農民及早發現問題，及時採取措施，提高產量。", "育種家可以利用這項技術，快速篩選出具有優良基因的植物品種。例如，想要培育抗旱能力更強的稻米，透過AI分析，就能更快找到適合的品種，縮短育種時間，加速培育出適應氣候變遷的新品種。", "這項技術也能應用在都市園藝上。如果你在家裡種植盆栽，可以透過App分析植物的生長情況，了解是否需要澆水、施肥，讓AI成為你的園藝小幫手，輕鬆打造綠意盎然的居家環境。"], "audio": "audios/40535926.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-06-19T15:18:27.563828"}

We carried out this study, to reduce treatment related toxicities without compromising treatment efficacy.\nOBJECTIVES: Evaluate L-carnitine in reducing toxicities in HNSCC patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiation.\nMETHODOLOGY: Study conducted in the Department of Radiotherapy tertiary care center in Northern India from August 2018 to 2020. All patients were randomized into the study arm and control arm; the study arm received oral L-carnitine 500 mg thrice daily, with symptomatic treatment for chemoradiotherapy-induced toxicity. The control arm received only symptomatic treatment for chemoradiation-induced toxicities. Toxicity assessment was done biweekly during treatment using RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) criteria for toxicity assessment. Nutritional assessment was done by comparing hemoglobin, albumin, and weight loss during treatment. Fatigue was assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and the quality of life was assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Response evaluation for the primary tumor and neck nodes was done using RECIST 1.1.\nRESULTS: Significant decrease in severity and delay in onset of dermatitis, mucositis, laryngeal reactions, and dysphagia were observed; however, no such benefit was seen in xerostomia. Treatment response was comparable in both arms. Mean post-treatment BFI in the test arm versus control arm was 37.22 and 52.24 (p-value 0.042), respectively. 28.75% of patients in the control arm and none in the study arm had albumin levels < 3.4 g/dL. Median weight loss in the test arm was 5.2% and in the control arm was 7.4%.
